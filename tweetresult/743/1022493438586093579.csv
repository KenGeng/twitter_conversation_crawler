"Poorly written article using a study that itself states that other health related issues exist from sitting all day. Additionally, the whole point of a standing desk is to switch between standing and sitting. Not standing still all day till your legs are numb. Unintelligent.",ez1to3,aytekintank,https://twitter.com/ez1to3/status/1022850310241439745,1532701492

"I switched to a standing desk 3 years ago. I didn’t pay a grand, I put my stuff at the right heights using my old IKEA IVAR shelves - total cost about fifty quid.
The arthritis in my knees (which was crippling) is gone. I no longer feel sleepy in the afternoon. 
Never going back.",gudnameztaken,aytekintank,https://twitter.com/gudnameztaken/status/1023591211100188677,1532878136

Irresponsibly “researched” article. Sitting for eight hours a day is HORRIBLE  for a human being’s body.,TheRainbowHelix,aytekintank,https://twitter.com/TheRainbowHelix/status/1023242824257400838,1532795074

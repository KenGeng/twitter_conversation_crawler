"I am assembling an army of Chanseys, which will eventually become an army of Blisseys.",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024738756819996672,1533151733
"Before a week or so ago I had zero Blisseys and maybe 3 or 4 Chanseys, all hatched from eggs I think.  Then I started driving around south Puget Sound to exploit the current Chansey quest, ""Hatch Five Eggs"".",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024738936592064512,1533151775
"Certain level 40 players in my area have quite a few maxed-out Blisseys that they can deploy in gyms.  One guy in particular, I noticed one day he dropped one in each of the four Hylebos Wetlands Park gyms.",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739018859208704,1533151795
"I was like, dang he has FOUR of those?  Maybe more!  That become a long-term goal of mine, to be able to do exactly that.",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739061871702016,1533151805
"Last week I drove to Kent and gathered up three Chansey quests, and by the next day I had three new Chanseys.  I evolved one into a Blissey and began leveling it up.",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739139109969929,1533151824
Two days later I drove back to Kent to grab another quest.  Somewhere around this time I hatched a Blissey from a 10k egg as well.,MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739194063605760,1533151837
Saturday I drove down to Tacoma late in the evening and along the waterfront boardwalk to grab another of these quests that someone had pointed out.,MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739243866828800,1533151849
"Last night I hatched another Chansey.  I had three 10k eggs, and the first was a Trapinch, then a Slakoth, but the last was a Chansey.  Score!",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739320932982785,1533151867
"Today is August 1st, and the research tasks will change at 1 PM.  That doesn't necessarily mean my Chansey quests will go away, but they might.  Today could be my last chance at one!",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739383906189312,1533151882
"Someone posted in the Auburn Line channel about one of these quests in downtown Auburn.  I think that quest will only be there until 1 PM today, so on my lunch break I drove to Auburn and grabbed it.  ^_^",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739455112949761,1533151899
Right now I have two Blisseys and eight Chanseys.  The new quest will give me a ninth.  My Blissey/Chansey army is taking shape!  Now I just need to walk them for candy to level them up.  I need to do a LOT of that!,MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024739519319269377,1533151914
"By the way, I read that the Alolan eggs have changed again.  Alolan Rattatas are no longer hatching from them (yay!) and Alolan Vulpix is hatching more frequently (also yay!) although I still think it's rare.  But that might explain why I have three now.",MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024740253062451200,1533152089
So I got four Alolan eggs incubating right now.  ^_^  Gotta get that Chansey!,MintRainbow1,,https://twitter.com/MintRainbow1/status/1024740395626815488,1533152123

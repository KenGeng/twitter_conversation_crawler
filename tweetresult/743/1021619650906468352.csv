"I know I said this recently but I have to reemphasize just how much I love Radiohead. I just. They make me feel more than any other music ever has or ever will. They make my heart swell, they make it break, and they put the pieces back together, in every single song.",squeemonster,,https://twitter.com/squeemonster/status/1021619650906468352,1532408080
"When my daughter was a baby, Radiohead was the only thing that would soothe her in the car. She would always stop crying to listen. Just found out they’re playing my city on Thursday, but I can’t go. :(",Ardeospina,squeemonster,https://twitter.com/Ardeospina/status/1021839631342620674,1532460527

"I saw them once about...eight? Years ago? When they toured to support In Rainbows. It was excellent. And it was an outdoor venue, so we sat on the lawn and only paid like $30 for a ticket, which I thought was pretty damn good.",Ardeospina,squeemonster,https://twitter.com/Ardeospina/status/1021872104122273793,1532468269

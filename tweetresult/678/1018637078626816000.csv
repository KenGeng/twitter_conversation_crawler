"""Sonic Forces is too linear, that's why it sucks"" is the most ignorant complaint about this title.

It's completely fine if you don't like Sonic Forces, but if that's the only reason you dislike it and you like other lineral 3D Sonic titles, then...

"That's just bullshit. Of course, you may have others problems with Forces, but if you don't and ""linearity"" is your only problem, while you love other Sonic titles for the same thing, then you don't even know what you like.

(Yes, I'm making this point twice, so people notice it)",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637124915154944,1531696990
"Some people, SOME don't even know why they dislike the game in the first place. The problem isn't the linearity. All 3D Sonic games are linear. Don't even get me started on this, because I hate when people argue about this topic. Games are simply more or less linear, that's it.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637166455422976,1531697000
"And Forces doesn't even fall for the most linear category either. Heroes has a lot more linear corridors and rooms where you constantly fight enemies. SA2 is all linear, except Final Rush. Unleashed has long levels, but is also very linear. The storybook games are all on-rails.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637216506105856,1531697012
"The thing is: all of these are perfectly fine games. So what's Forces' excuse to get hate for ""linearity""?

""You just run straight"".
Literally only Lost Valley and Luminous Forest have long sections where you just run forward most of the time. What, two levels make the game bad?",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637269081653249,1531697024
"And are we forgetting the linear levels from Unleashed... like Apotos, where you just run straight all the time? Jungle Joyride is 5 minutes long, but it's also painfully linear. Now, don't get me wrong. Unleashed was able to hide its linear design. How? Well...",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637309149839361,1531697034
"The reason why you may dislike Forces isn't the linearity or automation. It's the fact that the game:
- has short levels
- has barely any setpieces.
THAT'S THE REASON. Jungle Joyride is linear in Unleashed, but it's really fun to play, because it's long and has action setpieces.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637351038455815,1531697044
"But understand this:
Linearity =/= bad
Long levels =/= good
Forces' best levels are the ones that have setpieces, like Capital City for example. You run through lineral hallways with a few Wispon options, but the action makes up for it and ends up as a very memorable, fun level.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637414842163200,1531697059
"It's similar with Secret Rings. We don't hate the linearity. We hate the controls. The level design in that game is memorable, because it has setpieces, like surfing on water in Pirate Storm. We love City Escape, a very linear level, but it's fun, because it has fun setpieces.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637466033643520,1531697071
"We love Emerald Coast, a level with only one option to go on a different path, but it's fun and memorable, because of the Orca that chases us midway through. The linear design also makes an ""illusion"" that it's open, but it's not. It just has wider spaces to collect item boxes.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637504663179266,1531697081
"Heck, Shadow the Hedgehog offers a lot of levels who do give you options to choose different paths and options, but people hate that game for many reasons and it's not linearity, because that game's not the most linear Sonic title. They dislike the controls, missions, story etc.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637559935782913,1531697094
"People consider Black Knight to be ""underrated"" and that game's VERY LINEAR. You see the pattern? You don't dislike the linearity. There are others problems, but you're too ignorant or blind to find them. Sonic Team listens to you. Don't give them the wrong idea.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637596694667264,1531697103
"Don't tell them that Forces is ""too linear"", because linearity isn't your problem here. Making Sonic open-world isn't gonna make things better. Lost World had many paths to take. People still disliked that game and its problem wasn't the linearity. There were other problems.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637635236089857,1531697112
"Your problem in Forces isn't the linearity. That's what 3D Sonic is - a linear platformer. Forces isn't even close to being the most linear Sonic title. Besides Lost Valley and Luminous Forest, a lot of other stages provide multiple ways to finish the level.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637676973576193,1531697122
"You simply may dislike the short length of levels or how similar some of them feel, because they lack setpieces except a few exceptions like Capital City, Aqua Road or Null Space. You may not feel the satisfaction of beating the level, because of these two things.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637710204993537,1531697130
"You may have other problems like the limited moveset for Sonic or the controls. Tell them that. Don't tell them that it's too linear, because it's not. Tell them that the levels are too short and lack cool action setpieces, that you want them to feel different from each other.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637746141827078,1531697138
"Telling them that there's too much 2D or automation is a bad move too. These games need 2D sections, because they'd feel empty without them. You simply don't want to swallow this fact. And the automation wouldn't be noticed if the levels were longer for example.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637791104774144,1531697149
"Because a lot of our favourite levels in the Sonic series that have cool action setpieces are automated in those areas.
Orca Chase - Automated
GUN Truck - Automated
Heroes Car - Automated (you only jump)
Chases in Unleashed - Automated (you only quickstep)

But they're still fun!",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637834230685696,1531697159
"I'll mention it again. Capital City in Forces has very automated action setpieces, but if you ask people what their favourite levels are from that game, then you'll often hear ""Capital City"", despite it being one of the most automated levels in the game if you think about it.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018637879403216897,1531697170
"Summary: This is only towards those people who dislike Forces for ""linearity"" and ""automation"" while liking other 3D Sonic titles. If you have other problems with Forces, this thread isn't against you at all. I'm sure you have fair reasons, but remember to use them in a good way.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018638030863831041,1531697206
"Don't just tell Sonic Team to fuck off and hire fans to make a new 3D title. Christian wasn't hired just like that. He had his time to prove himself when porting CD, 1 and 2 to smartphones. And I'm still yet to find a fan who made a good Sonic 3D fan game and is not a dick.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018638069241704448,1531697215
"Christian and his team weren't just fans. They were developers. DEVELOPERS! It's not like SEGA just picked random fans from the internet. No, they hired talent who happened to adore the Sonic series. These people didn't make Mania to shit on SEGA. It's made out of love for Sonic.",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018638119103598592,1531697227
"And if you genuinely think that Sonic Team are just lazy asses who purposely make bad Sonic games to make easy profit, then...

How the fuck can you call yourself a Sonic fan?",RustleWolfie,,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018638175252762624,1531697241
"I know you're trying to justify for the ""linear hate"" Forces gets, and I get that. Most Sonic games are very linear. However, the things that make Forces worse than those other titles is that it was rushed and was overall a bad game.",hilarious_feg,RustleWolfie,https://twitter.com/hilarious_feg/status/1018672796681924608,1531705495
"I stated at the end that this is only targeted towards those who pull the ""linearity"" card. Other criticisms are fine. I just wanted to make a point that the ""linearity"" argument is stupid and ignorant.",RustleWolfie,hilarious_feg,https://twitter.com/RustleWolfie/status/1018674890373779456,1531705994

"The biggest reason why I find Forces to be a disappointment is not the linearity, it's the short levels and lack of delivering a compelling experience in terms of level length and design.

"The linearity isnt even the problem, it's the fact the game was boring, rushed, unpolished to hell.

Not to mention the fact Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Classic Sonic were added to pander to the Classic purists. Heck Sky Sanctuary was added to the mobile game to pander more",Marshy_Dragon,RustleWolfie,https://twitter.com/Marshy_Dragon/status/1018966997772783616,1531775638

Linear huh *looks at SA2* in all seriousness I get the complaint but I feel it's more like the game runs on auto pilot which may be why people consider it so linear. I wouldn't get too upset about it bro.,Olimar651,RustleWolfie,https://twitter.com/Olimar651/status/1018711555804991488,1531714736

For the record there’s no chance that the Orca in the picture is even jumping 50 ft,KrisIodice,Alien_Anth_Farm,https://twitter.com/KrisIodice/status/936052167315771392,1512007202

"This animal is a genius and is a brute, we don't let them back into the wild after sea world because if one in captivity ever got back to the wild it would tell other orcas about how screwed up the upright mammals are and they would take out anyone in the water.",jtmelvan,Alien_Anth_Farm,https://twitter.com/jtmelvan/status/935914493866950656,1511974378
"Lol I agree with that, they are one of the most interesting animals on this planet. I was just being sarcastic about the 50 feet, an orca can jump at most around 15 feet.",Alien_Anth_Farm,jtmelvan,https://twitter.com/Alien_Anth_Farm/status/935914845450489856,1511974462
"Yeah 50 feet is a bit crazy, I don't doubt they could throw a seal 50feet in the air tho",jtmelvan,Alien_Anth_Farm,https://twitter.com/jtmelvan/status/935916004860817409,1511974738

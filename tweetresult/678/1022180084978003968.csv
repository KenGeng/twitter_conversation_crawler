That Shark Week show last night about Orcas ripping just the livers out of massive Great White sharks shows how badass and smart Orcas are. That is some unreal intelligence for an animal right there.,SportsGuyLance,,https://twitter.com/SportsGuyLance/status/1022180084978003968,1532541698
Watch them hunt seals. It’s incredible,Jasinjuh,SportsGuyLance,https://twitter.com/Jasinjuh/status/1022182552055017474,1532542286
I have and it’s amazing to see them go up on shore to get them or to create waves to wash them off icebergs or to playfully throw the seals back and forth but to know that they will kill massive creatures like a Great White to eat only their liver is a insane.,SportsGuyLance,Jasinjuh,https://twitter.com/SportsGuyLance/status/1022184242120409094,1532542689
It’s nuts they featured orcas in free Willy without telling kids they kill humans ,Jasinjuh,SportsGuyLance,https://twitter.com/Jasinjuh/status/1022184545054011392,1532542761
"An Orca has never killed a human in the wild though. In some parts of the world they take tourist by the boatload out and they all jump in the middle of an Orca pod and swim with them. They are not stupid like sharks, they know you are not food immediately.",SportsGuyLance,Jasinjuh,https://twitter.com/SportsGuyLance/status/1022185298443350016,1532542941

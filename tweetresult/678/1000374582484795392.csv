"I actually just calculated this last night.  From the Bubble I went out to the Crab Pulsar, and from there to Colonia.  From Colonia to Beagle Point & now on my return trip I'm at 150k light years.  I still have 50k LY back to the Bubble after Colonia.",CmdrJetsukai,"Travisfarrell22,EDBPE,GalPhotoED",https://twitter.com/CmdrJetsukai/status/1000376480461983745,1527343313

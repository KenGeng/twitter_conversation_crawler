Don't get me wrong I LOVE Joel but Ellie would be more interesting Bec she's still young and the story can continue..while Joel is pretty old now.,Iamsowanted,verdict4489,https://twitter.com/Iamsowanted/status/1004466780696391688,1528318517

"Ellie should die. I know 90% of people don't see it this way but TLoU is Joel's story. 1st game we saw him lose his daughter and had a time jump, heard about how dark he became. This game he should lose Ellie and experience his wrath firsthand. Hate is the theme after all",Virtual_Orca,verdict4489,https://twitter.com/Virtual_Orca/status/1004529423566168064,1528333452

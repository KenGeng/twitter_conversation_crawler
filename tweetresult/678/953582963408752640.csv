"Finished up Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, you know, the game where you're a bionic badass Interpol agent in the future? Yeah it's as great as it sounds, fun as hell!,pic.twitter.com/OTEJ4UUg2E",Virtual_Orca,,https://twitter.com/Virtual_Orca/status/953582963408752640,1516186869
Bought it at launch & still haven't played it.,62Thompson,Virtual_Orca,https://twitter.com/62Thompson/status/953583640121720832,1516187031
"Def check it out when you get a chance Dean, it's a pretty deep rpg with multiple ways to play and branching paths, plus the locations and the way they have you playing as a futuristic Interpol agent are very well done.",Virtual_Orca,62Thompson,https://twitter.com/Virtual_Orca/status/953585682764713985,1516187518
I even bought the hardbound strategy guide for it as I knew I would dig it.,62Thompson,Virtual_Orca,https://twitter.com/62Thompson/status/953594322397536257,1516189578
"Hell yeah a guide will def come in handy, I was bumblin through the first half of the game like Frank from Naked Gun lol, it has so many secrets and choices that can affect the endgame. I'd say it's only 15 -20 hours too which I liked, not too long and not too short,pic.twitter.com/E0dBxgD26z",Virtual_Orca,62Thompson,https://twitter.com/Virtual_Orca/status/953600916787269632,1516191150
Was pretty disappointed by it. Human Revolution is so much better.,_DoomSlayer_,Virtual_Orca,https://twitter.com/_DoomSlayer_/status/953622734902386688,1516196352
"Never played that one, but I wanted too. The new one is a lot of fun though,  hopefully they'll keep making em",Virtual_Orca,_DoomSlayer_,https://twitter.com/Virtual_Orca/status/953702958017011713,1516215478
"If you have a way to play it, I definitely recommend. Amazing game. The story was a hell of a lot more important.",_DoomSlayer_,Virtual_Orca,https://twitter.com/_DoomSlayer_/status/953705524746510336,1516216090
"Sounds good. I am picking up an Xbox one X in a few months so I will def play it if it's backwards compatible, I liked the story in MD but the recap they showed of HR in the beginning looked pretty crazy lol, can't wait to jump back into the series",Virtual_Orca,_DoomSlayer_,https://twitter.com/Virtual_Orca/status/953707503728066560,1516216562

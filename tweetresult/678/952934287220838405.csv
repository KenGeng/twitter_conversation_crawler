"Cyoidai GH-U e3-3 Nebula 
Several hundred light years above the Crab Nebula is this gem with a black hole core.  I'm glad I took a detour because this little nebula is quite stunning.

"Good heavens!  What a find!

I'll be visiting this once I get back.  That will be a nice trip to reacclimate to being back in my AspX once I have returned to The Bubble.",CMDRJimSmuzz,CmdrJetsukai,https://twitter.com/CMDRJimSmuzz/status/952950168638427136,1516035999
"I'm really starting to miss my Asp, been over 6 months since I've flown it.  Still sitting in Colonia where I left it.",CmdrJetsukai,CMDRJimSmuzz,https://twitter.com/CmdrJetsukai/status/952952165345234945,1516036475
"I miss mine terribly.

DGMW, I love my DBX.  It's absolutely fantastic!

But I'd like a wider fuel scoop and a cargo bay.  Just *1 too many * compromises using a DBX for longest range exploration (i.e. 12K lys and >)",CMDRJimSmuzz,CmdrJetsukai,https://twitter.com/CMDRJimSmuzz/status/952953522898784257,1516036799
"I feel the same way.  I really like the Diamondback, but that 4a scoop... On the bright side the added DBX refuel time gives me plenty of opportunities to go grab another beer ",CmdrJetsukai,CMDRJimSmuzz,https://twitter.com/CmdrJetsukai/status/952954229316096000,1516036967

"I will say that the DBX is more nimble and that 58 ly jump range is very, very nice.

It's also an uncookable ship.  Mine never heats up!",CMDRJimSmuzz,"CMDRJimSmuzz,CmdrJetsukai",https://twitter.com/CMDRJimSmuzz/status/952955418271199237,1516037251
When I finish this trip I'm going back to the drawing board on how I approach exploration & my ship builds.  3x now I've spectacularly crashed my orca.  So I may sacrifice jump range for survivability & comfort.,CmdrJetsukai,CMDRJimSmuzz,https://twitter.com/CmdrJetsukai/status/952958446386769921,1516037973
"Hi G landings?

Or troublesome maneuverability around stellar/planetary bodies?

FWIW.   I near bought it jet coning boosting off a DCO star yrday.  I always JC off of a slow parabolic path into the far cone.  I entered to close too quick and got thrown backward toward the star.",CMDRJimSmuzz,CmdrJetsukai,https://twitter.com/CMDRJimSmuzz/status/952967962738208769,1516040242

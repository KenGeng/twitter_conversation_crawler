"When I first saw Jaws as a kid, every time they showed this extended bow of the Orca, I thought the shark could jump out of the water and grab Quint (and me) any moment. 
Sadly, Jaws painted sharks as monsters and made people go kill them without remorse. They aren't vengeful.",JhnReed,OnePerfectShot,https://twitter.com/JhnReed/status/1021129454909878273,1532291208

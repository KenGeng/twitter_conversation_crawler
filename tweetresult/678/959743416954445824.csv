"Take to the skies in style, sporting a fresh lick of paint! The Orca Prestige Pack is now available for all platforms, find it for PC here: ,http://,bit.ly/2s3YjsG, , or via the ingame Frontier Store for consoles.,pic.twitter.com/2nv1gkHoLa",EliteDangerous,,https://twitter.com/EliteDangerous/status/959743416954445824,1517655636
"Could we get an actual game to go with these paint jobs? Great engine, zero gameplay. I log on, think “wow, look at that cockpit,” then log onto the mission board. Nothing but bland emptiness. Like an incomplete tech demo. Get your act together Frontier. So much potential & nada!",Y2Krashman,EliteDangerous,https://twitter.com/Y2Krashman/status/959746106870530048,1517656277
You could join a player group or something like that. A big-ish player group will most likely have some low key work that needs to be done. But you so realise that it is also a space sim? You won't find adventure unless you go looking for it!,Enigma_Solovar,"Y2Krashman,EliteDangerous",https://twitter.com/Enigma_Solovar/status/959754570812608513,1517658295
"I have 1500 hrs in the tech demo. Games such as Privateer, that predate it by 20+ years have what this lacks. NPC mission givers and interlinked missions that have narratives.

"""Zero gameplay""
""1500 hours""
There are some mixed messages here...",vgamer4,"Y2Krashman,Enigma_Solovar,EliteDangerous",https://twitter.com/vgamer4/status/959860257878085632,1517683493
"No mixed message: I wanted desperately for the game to be good, because the engine and flight model is excellent. I kept imagining I’d find the gameplay to match. Alas, 1500 hours searching for fun. On the only realistic looking VR of its time. As vacuous as its’ empty space.",Y2Krashman,"vgamer4,Enigma_Solovar,EliteDangerous",https://twitter.com/Y2Krashman/status/959862915577753601,1517684127
"""I played 1500 hours of this game and enjoyed none of it."" Sure buddy, and I like to drop anvils on my feet just to see if it's fun after the 5th time I do it.",vgamer4,"Y2Krashman,Enigma_Solovar,EliteDangerous",https://twitter.com/vgamer4/status/959869238461771776,1517685634
Hint for those slow on the uptake: there’s a difference between badly wanting to like something and actually liking it. It’s a great flight engine. There’s no game. Anything else you’d like to tell me about what I do and do not like?,Y2Krashman,"vgamer4,Enigma_Solovar,EliteDangerous",https://twitter.com/Y2Krashman/status/959872057424068608,1517686306
"If you spend 1500 hours ""wanting"" to like something then your time management seems a bit askew. All I am saying is, even after hundreds of hours of playing, I am still discovering new ways to play. That definitely doesn't seem like no gameplay.",vgamer4,"Y2Krashman,Enigma_Solovar,EliteDangerous",https://twitter.com/vgamer4/status/959924211547623426,1517698741

The Orca needs some serious love! As of right now there's just no reason to pilot it. It excels at nothing and is the least popular ship in the game. Either give it way more internals to be an elegant cargo/passenger ship or bump it's jump range to be a beautiful explorer! :),Papa_Sylar,EliteDangerous,https://twitter.com/Papa_Sylar/status/959836075882622976,1517677728

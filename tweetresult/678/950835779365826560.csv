"I can't think of one new game worth getting for the life of me, tomorrow I'm getting a full refund from my Gamestop manager for the horrid Project Cars 2, maybe a money card for Wolfenstein 2 season pass.",62Thompson,,https://twitter.com/62Thompson/status/950835779365826560,1515531890
Dude..  Other than getting RDR 2 I have no plans on getting anything besides monster hunter but that's a niche and guilty pleasure.  2018 doesn't look that great.  I'm hoping the new metro and anthem end up being awesome.,Metalhead9806,62Thompson,https://twitter.com/Metalhead9806/status/951063850610241536,1515586266

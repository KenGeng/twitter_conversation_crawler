"Cetaceans captured from Taiji are not sent to Western marine parks. ,https://www.,google.com/maps/d/u/0/vie,wer?mid=1rEv15Oas-8KiYapgKTkBH6j9reA&ll=41.8808114859875%2C68.56210548593754&z=3, ,…, Marine parks do not use chlorine in corrosive amounts. Most have filtered salt water. They're not forced.

They are not forced? If this was the case wouldn't all the animals currently held captive in these environments have volunteered to migrate from the depths of the ocean especially to live the rest of their lives in a tank? If you were an orca which life would you choose? (1/2),ForTheirVoice,"MooseMusing,ellrhys",https://twitter.com/ForTheirVoice/status/934759350853341184,1511698970
It is common knowledge & fact that all these sea creatures are forced into these environments against their will. There is no choice when the conditions set up by man are unavoidable & built to in prison them for spectator amusement. Please watch BBC's Blue Planet if you can. 2/2,ForTheirVoice,"ForTheirVoice,ellrhys",https://twitter.com/ForTheirVoice/status/934760174304350208,1511699167
"What about the ones rescued and can’t be returned back to the wild, because they have a severe injury, like damaged vertebra, missing tail fluke, or another injury. They are not forced. They need human care. Oh and like an otter that raised a pet, but could not be taken care of",Kimberlee711,"ForTheirVoice,ellrhys",https://twitter.com/Kimberlee711/status/935134799089553408,1511788484
"Do you think Winter, could survive in the wild or a sea side sanctuary. I don’t think so.",Kimberlee711,"Kimberlee711,ForTheirVoice",https://twitter.com/Kimberlee711/status/935135328985337856,1511788611
This is a particularly stupid response. The request is that captive orcas and cetaceans are put in SAFE monitored 'sea sanctuarys' with space and 'live food resources'. Living in social groups. Near to wild habitat/conditions.,ellrhys,"Kimberlee711,ForTheirVoice",https://twitter.com/ellrhys/status/935138452487761920,1511789355
I think it was the usual standard response from someone trying - very weakly - to justify keeping all these poor souls in captivity! Yes SAFE sanctuary is the key. They choose to ignore that important word to serve their aims to retain their 'entertainment',mlb5555ed,"ellrhys,Kimberlee711",https://twitter.com/mlb5555ed/status/935211258520928256,1511806714

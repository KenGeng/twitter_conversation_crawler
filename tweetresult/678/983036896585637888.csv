"okay i need to write down the terrible nightmare i had last night. i was on the beach with many people for some sort of festival. then, in the distance we saw a trial missile launch for NASA. the missile went about a mile up and then began to fall back to earth. a failed launch.",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983036896585637888,1523209234
"it cascaded toward the sea and plunged deep to the bottom, exploding on impact with the sea floor. as the explosion thrashed through the water, you could see many forms of sea animals being harmed and killed. dolphins, fish, sea lions, and orcas all started (+)",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983037062491193344,1523209274
"frantically jumping out of the water to escape the blast. some did not make it, or were to young to jump. one in particular was a newborn baby orca. in the dream it was unrealistically small, probably only 4 feet long and about 80 pounds. in any case, it beached itself while (+)",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983037157920202754,1523209297
"trying to escape the explosion. i frantically ran over to the baby whale and began rolling it from the sand back into the waves so that it would not die. i got it into the water and was holding it with both hands at my waist, and i saw it was too tired to swim. it would drown if",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983037242385027072,1523209317
"i simply dropped it and went ashore. however, i am deeply afraid of the ocean due to sharks primarily, so i was unable to stay in the water to help the baby stay afloat. i frantically cried out to people nearby to help the newborn orca swim. two women ran over to help",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983037354204999681,1523209343
"and, weeping, i explained i was unable to do it myself because of my fear of sharks. they were willing to help but did not understand that they had to keep the baby underwater, but also surface it every couple minutes so the newborn orca could use its blowhole to breathe,",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983037436606451714,1523209363

"so the women who volunteered to help were staying in the shallows as they carried the whale along in their arms, keeping it underwater mostly and barely remembering to lift it up to breathe periodically until i shouted at them. they did not seem to grasp the importance of that.",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983037707067822080,1523209427
"it was a terribly stressful dream and i was relieved to wake up. i can still feel how the baby whale's smooth, wet skin felt in my arms and how desperately its eyes looking up at me, pleading for help.",hashtag_dta,,https://twitter.com/hashtag_dta/status/983037802978971648,1523209450

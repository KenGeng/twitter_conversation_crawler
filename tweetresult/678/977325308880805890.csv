"Should I go from 390 to 317 hull for 2 LY extra jump range in my DBX? I'm going to be out there a while without hull limpets, but hull damage is always a thing with deep space exploration.

Have you tried engineering your stock hull for heavy duty?  It adds no weight.,CmdrJetsukai,steffkicksass,https://twitter.com/CmdrJetsukai/status/977335069856620544,1521849813
"That would take me to just over 300, but the extra 80(ish) hull would make me feel safer for a multiple month trip. I'm trying to balance my hate of risk with wanting to be able to fly 3k + above the galactic plane!",steffkicksass,CmdrJetsukai,https://twitter.com/steffkicksass/status/977338118721306625,1521850540
I dropped my Orca's jump range down for the peace of mind of a strong hull land a powerful shield for my Beagle Point trip.  Still at 45.  Surviving if more important than a few LY's!,CmdrJetsukai,steffkicksass,https://twitter.com/CmdrJetsukai/status/977341205758357504,1521851276
How did your hull hold up for that trip?,steffkicksass,CmdrJetsukai,https://twitter.com/steffkicksass/status/977354678563475457,1521854488
"I'm 4000 LY to Beagle Point still, and I'm 98% hull, which is due to an accidental crash into some rings.  My shields are nearly 700 mj and I can hit multiple asteroids or snack a canyon wall without taking damage.",CmdrJetsukai,steffkicksass,https://twitter.com/CmdrJetsukai/status/977359833497251840,1521855717

"Don't do it.
I'd push the DBX to absolute limit just to see how far it could go, in theory, then kit out for a proper expedition. 2LY ain't worth potential death and loss of exploration data.",CMDR_Lutzie,steffkicksass,https://twitter.com/CMDR_Lutzie/status/977328437600821249,1521848232
"Data's not such a big worry, but I know occasionally I like a beer while flying. A couple of close shaves in a reinforced AspX or a factory Annie has been been ok, but a couple of poorly judged Scoops and a thin DBX and I could be toast!

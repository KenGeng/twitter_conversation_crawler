"I agree, but it’s still penguins on an ice floe to use my favourite metaphor. They crowd the ice floe until one jumps in. If it’s not eaten by an orca they all jump in.

"Yep. I do feel like we’re getting somewhere but there are still a lot of schools tracking predominantly for Ofsted et al, placing huge demands on teachers for no discernible benefit.

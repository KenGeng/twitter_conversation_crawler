"This is not even a competitive one. Even  the best looking Pro games suffer from shorter draw distances and soft image quality when not in photo mode.  Oh oh.  Salty tears incoming.

"I own both an Xbox one X and PS4 Pro. While I love horizon zero dawn and have many hours under my belt. Xbox one X hammers Pro not just with power or the fact games look better and play better. I'm also impressed how ,@,Xbox, make old 360 games look and play better. It's a beast",ChrisGMurchison,"MrAssassin11,verdict4489",https://twitter.com/ChrisGMurchison/status/969568623114235905,1519998148
No one will deny that the multiplats like Call Of Duty and Assassinâ€™s Creed look better on the Xbox One X. Where the PlayStation 4 Pro shines is in its exclusives. Uncharted 4 and Horiozn Zero Dawn look beautiful. Nothing comes close.,MrAssassin11,"ChrisGMurchison,verdict4489,Xbox",https://twitter.com/MrAssassin11/status/969601572106899456,1520006003
"Horizon is the best looking PS4 Pro game no doubt, uncharted looks a bit better but not by much. Sony in my opinion should have waited an extra year but a few extra gig of ram inside with a 4k drive. That's why now they are already talking about PS5 they know pro was a mistake.",ChrisGMurchison,"MrAssassin11,verdict4489,Xbox",https://twitter.com/ChrisGMurchison/status/969615943226753024,1520009430
Ps4 pro was far from a mistake. Your comment was a mistake.,pdut23,"ChrisGMurchison,MrAssassin11",https://twitter.com/pdut23/status/970107963565379585,1520126736
"Also uncharted 4 doesn't run at native 4k (it's 1440p) most first party titles on Xbox One X (Gears 4, Forza 7, Halo 5 etc) are all native 4k, Gears 4 even offers a 60fps mode, why doesn't Sony offer that?",ChrisGMurchison,"pdut23,MrAssassin11",https://twitter.com/ChrisGMurchison/status/970245402921455616,1520159505
Uncharted 4 and Horizon look better. Simple as that. Developer quality super seeds all these kinds of debates.,_petef,"ChrisGMurchison,verdict4489",https://twitter.com/_petef/status/970300418902372353,1520172621
not sure how anyone could choose the PS4 Pro just as I wouldve said the reverse if comparing the og  XB1 and and PS4. Lotta fanboys in here I guess ....smh,EternalDragonX1,"verdict4489,Under_Ach1ever",https://twitter.com/EternalDragonX1/status/968968112413532160,1519854975
I got the PS4 pro to play my Exclusive which is a lot at its best with my Sony 4K/HDR TV how is that hard to understand and 3rd party is whatever,N3XT_G3N,"EternalDragonX1,verdict4489,Under_Ach1ever",https://twitter.com/N3XT_G3N/status/968969585398636545,1519855326

I can't even believe there's a debate happening here. Stop the fan boy bullshit. It's common sense. X is the more capable console.,StuDeblob,verdict4489,https://twitter.com/StuDeblob/status/969752827546480640,1520042065

"Uncharted 4, Shadow Of The Colossus remake, Gran Turismo ( yes it better looking than Forza 7) Horizon Zero Dawn are graphically better than ANYTHING Xbox has or will have. They donâ€™t have the talent in there first party lineup. Last Of Us 2 on the horizon.",justin0862,"verdict4489,tru8888",https://twitter.com/justin0862/status/969080898057658369,1519881865

"Sony generally has better looking exclusives due to their single player focus but 99% of multiplat games should/will look better on 1X. 
Horizon looks awesome especially for open world but Gears 4 on 1X is mind blowing and so is FH3. Anyway got both so I'm lucky haha",blitz23NZ,verdict4489,https://twitter.com/blitz23NZ/status/968972796607909888,1519856092

"My DBX has a 48LY jump range, and that's with A-rated power plant and thrusters, and a full tool kit. It also runs absurdly cool. , ,#,EliteDangerous, ,#,EnigmaExpedition",OneOldDuck,,https://twitter.com/OneOldDuck/status/950735240456298501,1515507919
I'm fine with a 2A powerplant. Can jump while fuel scooping without overheating/heat sink... that's just crazy.,CmdrSereina,OneOldDuck,https://twitter.com/CmdrSereina/status/950834299418406913,1515531537
"I think my FSD is in a sweet range, because if I drop everything and go with D rated (or smaller A rated), I only gain 4LY, so I think I'm inside the top of the curve before jump range starts quickly dropping off with mass. I was running 3A PP for awhile, but it gained me little.",OneOldDuck,CmdrSereina,https://twitter.com/OneOldDuck/status/950839979311288322,1515532891
Seems about right. My range is 52 ly with 2A power plant and 4D thrusters.,CmdrSereina,OneOldDuck,https://twitter.com/CmdrSereina/status/950843172653031425,1515533652
Those are pretty good jump ranges. My dependable old AspX does 42ly fully laden with 2 SRVs and an enormous fuel scoop. It's not as impressive as yours but I'm comfortable with it :-),67MistakeNot,"CmdrSereina,OneOldDuck",https://twitter.com/67MistakeNot/status/950850156685090817,1515535317
"A fast fuel scoop can help compensate for a shorter jump range. I went on a short exploration run in my Orca with a huge scoop, and it was jump, honk-n-dip (fuel scoop), jump again. DBX introduces a little bit of wait during the ""dip"" part.",OneOldDuck,"67MistakeNot,CmdrSereina",https://twitter.com/OneOldDuck/status/950866903190441984,1515539310
"Yes and no. The DBX uses almost no fuel for a 50 ly jump, so I don't even have to slow down to be back to full before jumping again.",CmdrSereina,"OneOldDuck,67MistakeNot",https://twitter.com/CmdrSereina/status/950868057102184458,1515539585
Sounds like mine...,CmdrACB,OneOldDuck,https://twitter.com/CmdrACB/status/950736726498185216,1515508274

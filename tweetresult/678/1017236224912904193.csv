What’s this one? Looks nice,actual_fax,delevrything,https://twitter.com/actual_fax/status/1017252398568312832,1531366846
"Elite Dangerous, it's more of an actual flight sim / space life. 

EVE is more like the real world politics and more meta-game with boring gameplay.

Elite dangerous is the flip of that, fun af gameplay but veeeeery little meta-game.",delevrything,actual_fax,https://twitter.com/delevrything/status/1017252647374647299,1531366905

"I've never had a passenger ship before, how is that thing?",honorless_one,delevrything,https://twitter.com/honorless_one/status/1017237278333136897,1531363241
"Being a glorified taxicab is kind of relaxing

The only downside is that it's kind of like being a trucker in real life

Gotta take breaks or you'll go nuts 

For example I'm having a dude pay me 4 million but I have to travel like 90 jumps

And I'm halfway through the mission rn",delevrything,honorless_one,https://twitter.com/delevrything/status/1017237649885749248,1531363329
"word I've done tons of passenger missions, they are mind numbing but insanely lucrative (plus you'll be an elite explorer pretty quickly if you also drop some scans). I've just never flown a dolphin or an orca - what's the jump range like?",honorless_one,delevrything,https://twitter.com/honorless_one/status/1017241632217825281,1531364279
"It's pretty good, I mean it's not the best but I also don't have a super high class dolphin.",delevrything,honorless_one,https://twitter.com/delevrything/status/1017241895544737793,1531364341

I just came back to it today learning that they added squads and they fixed missions from being pointless and boring finally,delevrything,brownteaming,https://twitter.com/delevrything/status/1017236596779814912,1531363078

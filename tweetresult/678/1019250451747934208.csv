"My advice is to take your time and explore. If you go too fast you'll miss some great world-building. There's a wonderful adventure to be had if you indulge your curiosity.

And save the trees because the world is beautiful :)",WebdiveGeoff,"Virtual_Orca,JeremyPenter,BlueIsleStudio",https://twitter.com/WebdiveGeoff/status/1019413507798982657,1531882094
"Ok thank you! Might be a poor comparison cuz I haven't actually played it yet, but the trailer and review gave me vibes of Crisis and Journey lol. Both great games that I enjoyed taking my time with!",Virtual_Orca,"WebdiveGeoff,JeremyPenter,BlueIsleStudio",https://twitter.com/Virtual_Orca/status/1019422933658357760,1531884342

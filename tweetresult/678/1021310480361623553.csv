"They look great ,#,fishlady, one of our goldfish a few weeks ago on one of the hottest days decided to do an orca jump out of the tank. Came home to find it on the kitchen floor but okay and still swimming around happily now. Was very strange tho & about 4ft up too.,pic.twitter.com/R0PyKJYXjx",CronoYellow27,Meltonguemodel,https://twitter.com/CronoYellow27/status/1021316845767462912,1532335885

"I know I couldn't believe it. Not sure how long it had been there, we'd been out about 5hrs. It wasn't moving till I started to pick it up and it's tail fin moved. Put it in a bowl to let it come round & make sure ok then back in tank. Miracle fish. Crazy...",CronoYellow27,Meltonguemodel,https://twitter.com/CronoYellow27/status/1021329131273900032,1532338814

"Thanks, they've always been bigger than I expected on a goldfish. Great feature though when they swim round.",CronoYellow27,Meltonguemodel,https://twitter.com/CronoYellow27/status/1021348858553602049,1532343518

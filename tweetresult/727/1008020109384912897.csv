Some reports indicate the driver was drunk. If this is the case then I suspect that it wasn't a terror attack.,jremes84,"guyelster,IntelCrab",https://twitter.com/jremes84/status/1008020861700526081,1529165876
"Russian authorities have confirmed that it was an accident. One must always remember that the driving culture in Moscow is a bit different than in America.

There is a fatalist approach to safety and many drivers licenses are simply bought.,jremes84,"jremes84,Al_Gorelioni",https://twitter.com/jremes84/status/1008079803247886336,1529179928

"Hey dude i am by no means a fan of what he did or even a fan of his music but he was still a kid he died at 20, he hardly lived his life at all. Do you know how much would of happend in his life that he'll never be able to experience. The fact you think this way makes me sad.",majua0220,drunkswede,https://twitter.com/majua0220/status/1009111152004157440,1529425821

Hey im gay too and i think that's fucked up but that still doesn't take away from the fact that he was really young. Your mind isnt fully developed at that age.,majua0220,drunkswede,https://twitter.com/majua0220/status/1009131998177308673,1529430791
"Maybe if he lived longer he would have realized what he did was wrong and influenced his millions of fans not to make those mistakes, instead of dying and not learning his lesson.",majua0220,"majua0220,drunkswede",https://twitter.com/majua0220/status/1009132141165404160,1529430825

Yeah but he wasn't killed by someone he abused are the gay person he beat up he was killed by some random person who felt they had the right to take someone's life. Even if one of his victims killed him it wouldn't be right.,majua0220,drunkswede,https://twitter.com/majua0220/status/1009136566680383491,1529431881

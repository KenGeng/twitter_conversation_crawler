"What kind of player would you rather have next to KP --- Al Horford'ish or Robert Covington'ish? -- I think a big like Horford, brings it all together.

"Al Horford is a GREAT call to pair w/KP. 3&D rebounding big. Serge Ibaka another (cite ,@,ThomasCDee, former podcast)",Celenaali,stevekylerNBA,https://twitter.com/Celenaali/status/985560955030564865,1523811017

"""South Carolina state Rep. Katie Arrington, the candidate who defeated incumbent Rep. Mark Sanford  in the South Carolina GOP primary earlier this month, is in critical  but stable condition after she was seriously injured in a vehicle crash,  according to her campaign.""",NickyM96,,https://twitter.com/NickyM96/status/1011277210483855361,1529942250
"Mark Sanford is trash. He didn't need to be in office anyway. But Katie is a trump supporter. He even tweeted her well wishes. My neighbors had signs for her in their yard, so I guess that tells me their stance on him too. Those aren't even the neighbors w/the lawn jockey.",NickyM96,,https://twitter.com/NickyM96/status/1011277211649953795,1529942250
"We got a notification at work because one of the big wigs here was also in the car with that Katie chick and was injured badly too. They have a card set up and stuff. And I'm like ... oh, so they a trump supporter too? Pass. They can get my prayers, but that's it.",NickyM96,,https://twitter.com/NickyM96/status/1011277212950126592,1529942250

I’m really curious what’s up with Hollywood’s obsession with WW2 or Nazi films....I feel like those get greenlighted more than original content. Or is it just me?,MsPowerGranger,,https://twitter.com/MsPowerGranger/status/979364847212220417,1522333749
"But I’d like WWI to get some more exposure. But WWII definitely doesn’t need a film every year. It’s an interesting period of history to me, but it’s really the only one that’s taught with such detail.",emiljohns,MsPowerGranger,https://twitter.com/emiljohns/status/979371242519257088,1522335274
I’m just really over it. And war movies in general.,MsPowerGranger,emiljohns,https://twitter.com/MsPowerGranger/status/979371917806374913,1522335435
"WWII era films are so easy to produce because I think it’s one of the most closely studied historical periods worldwide. Vietnam...we lost that one, so not as fun to make films on wars you lost.",emiljohns,MsPowerGranger,https://twitter.com/emiljohns/status/979370792637968385,1522335167
"Man, Tropic Thunder was the best spoof of that war. And isn’t Apocalypse Now a cult movie? Takes place during Vietnam too",MsPowerGranger,emiljohns,https://twitter.com/MsPowerGranger/status/979371744694857728,1522335394

I’m terrified of going to see the new Star Wars because the second Rose Tico shows up onscreen I will one hundred percent proceed to sob uncontrollably for the whole movie.,Trungles,,https://twitter.com/Trungles/status/945893564587954177,1514353574
"I have literally never seen a Vietnamese person on the big screen before outside of the context of, like, the actual fucking Vietnam War. Nothing will be able to prepare me. It’s gonna be wild lmao",Trungles,,https://twitter.com/Trungles/status/945893935154651136,1514353662
LOL hold on I lied I saw Viet guys onscreen in that one X-Men movie where Jennifer fucking whatever Lawrence is “”speaking”” “”””Vietnamese””””” in that one scene. I’m gonna go ahead and say that doesn’t count on account of how terribad that whole thing was.,Trungles,,https://twitter.com/Trungles/status/945894517605126144,1514353801
Tbf she and Benicio Del Toro's characters are probably the best ones in the whole movie too.,mercurialblonde,Trungles,https://twitter.com/mercurialblonde/status/945916069885210624,1514358939

I think I'm finally going to get to see it tomorrow and now that's definitely what I'm going to think about the whole time she's up there. How much of the movie you're going to miss cuz your eyes are clouded to heck and again.,Desgardes,Trungles,https://twitter.com/Desgardes/status/945917359432388608,1514359247
You have to watch the movie twice to really appreciate it. The first time it's dazzling the second is like enjoying a good meal.,triptych,"Desgardes,Trungles",https://twitter.com/triptych/status/946037239674314753,1514387829

I can’t remember her name but I was SOBBING in the movie theater when I saw rose’s sister fighting. She was such a hero and even tho she had a small part there was so much emotion and thought behind her scene,pepemyson,Trungles,https://twitter.com/pepemyson/status/945898282634633216,1514354699
"I'm glad you're gonna get the experience my family had with Poe Dameron. Star Wars is massively huge on my latinx side and Poe having our ""family brow and nose"" was a religious experience.",ellameno,Trungles,https://twitter.com/ellameno/status/945897722359324672,1514354565
"I went in ready to defend Kelly Marie Tran to the death even if she was terrible just on principle, but she was one of the very best things about the movie and if I think about it too long I get all verklempt.",bettafish,Trungles,https://twitter.com/bettafish/status/946038742153875457,1514388187

"I LOVE HER SO MUCH, and yes, I bawled watching her, and probably lots of others will, too, so I hope you enjoy her!!

"Shoulda just been her and a bunch of porgs. Just flying around in a little cruiser, navigating hyperspace to deliver food to orphans on interesting planets. That’s the Star Wars we need.",CadeRoster,Trungles,https://twitter.com/CadeRoster/status/946085692228091904,1514399381

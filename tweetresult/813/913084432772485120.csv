i've been reading theories abt a likely dance of dragons 2.0 between dany & aegon and my heart is hurting,korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913084432772485120,1506531267
"i find it difficult to judge how daenerys would feel about aegon. assuming he's either the real deal or at least perceived as such, idk",korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913084674989264897,1506531325
"part of her would be happy to have a living family member but also, without marriage, he eliminates the claim she believes she has",korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913084840706297856,1506531364
and we know how much GRRM loves to twist and turn these characters into the total opposite of what they used to be/believe in,korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913085021635928069,1506531408
"if aegon gets dorne on side, wins the hearts of the people as rhaegar's son, that makes dany a usurper, the same as robert whom she hates",korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913085361731067904,1506531489
"daenerys prides herself on liberating westeros from wrongful rulers & hopefully winning their love, but if she fights aegon...",korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913085591306293248,1506531543
"daenerys going mad pains me but also intrigues me. i want it, but i don't. it's hard.... but i highly doubt she's gonna be happy abt aegon",korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913085959746486273,1506531631
"i don't think aegon is the real deal by any means, but i hope that remains a mystery to the people. i want US to know, not the characters",korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913086366061416449,1506531728
wasn't there something about a cloth dragon or a mummer's dragon in dany's house of the undying vision? crowds cheering? maybe not for her,korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913086573339664390,1506531778
"but for aegon, the false dragon. dany's temper isn't going to like that & for all her work to have been for nothing....dance of dragons baby",korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913086835815051267,1506531840
i'm so ready,korcariwilds,,https://twitter.com/korcariwilds/status/913086875765760000,1506531850

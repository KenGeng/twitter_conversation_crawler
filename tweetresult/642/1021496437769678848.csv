Hey. How you holding up? *he forces a smile*,MLP_SilverBulet,mlp_Kazue,https://twitter.com/MLP_SilverBulet/status/1021500302749585408,1532379625
"Do not cry over the broken flower, a new blooms nearby. *she smiles and walks to the cell door* I am alright, I hold no anger towards anyone.",mlp_Kazue,MLP_SilverBulet,https://twitter.com/mlp_Kazue/status/1021500628206583810,1532379702
"Well /I/ do! I must praise you for how calm you are in all this. You were put behind bars for a crime that you didn’t even commit. That unconscious lout Mr. Vivid DEMANDS a sum of money that you don’t even have. Poor Jamie’s mental state took a dramatic turn, almost for the worst",MLP_SilverBulet,mlp_Kazue,https://twitter.com/MLP_SilverBulet/status/1021501457097478144,1532379900
"Bring her here then, I might not cook but I am allowed to heal. *she smiles* and even that Mr. Vivid demands is harsh, I am glad they are trying to help him, I hope he gets well.",mlp_Kazue,MLP_SilverBulet,https://twitter.com/mlp_Kazue/status/1021502087539171328,1532380050
"Jamie’s fine now. After some words of encouragement in fact, she went to convince the judge to reevaluate and reopen your case.",MLP_SilverBulet,mlp_Kazue,https://twitter.com/MLP_SilverBulet/status/1021502394172145664,1532380124
"I hope that won't cause trouble. *she frowns a bit* what I do miss is just the smiles of others, to see them enjoy their lives in this beautiful world of ours.",mlp_Kazue,MLP_SilverBulet,https://twitter.com/mlp_Kazue/status/1021503125189013504,1532380298
"I think what would make others happy is if you weren’t in this cell. *he frowns* You don’t deserve this, Kazue. If there’s anyone that’ll cause trouble, it’s these idiots that DARE to throw mud on the name of a creature as peaceful as you are. The entire thing is outrageous.",MLP_SilverBulet,mlp_Kazue,https://twitter.com/MLP_SilverBulet/status/1021503616333635586,1532380415

"I will not be speaking
Henare will not be standing
The sun will not be shining
The birds will not be singing

They will not come

I will not be angry
The children will not laugh
The old woman will not smile.
You will not be good",AMidnightVoyage,,https://twitter.com/AMidnightVoyage/status/1018770909941805057,1531728887

A higher percentage of Republicans than Democrats voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It was Republicans whose 'Philadelphia Plan' in the 1970s sought to break the construction unions' racial barriers that kept blacks out of skilled trades.,7kidchaos,,https://twitter.com/7kidchaos/status/992643770008076288,1525499691

"Yes and here’s another Civil War tidbit:  At time of Civil War only 5% of southerners owned slaves, 3% nationwide.  Great Britain abolished slavery without shedding a drop of blood by converting slaves to employees over time and paying the slaveowners more money for a period.",7kidchaos,Purplelady77,https://twitter.com/7kidchaos/status/1019395800076517377,1531877872
"Why not use the census of 1860 instead.   Where 30% of households owned slaves?

"It's utterly perfect.  I couldn't have said it better myself.  And remember he was the less racist of the candidates for that election.

Yep. I knew that you’d have no response. That happens when you care more about spin than truth. So ask yourself why you’re willing to mislead people for the cause of racism.

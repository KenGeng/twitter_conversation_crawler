"this Trumpy claims character is important to her. Ahem....Stormy, grab-em-by-the-pussy, on 3rd wife, 19 assault accusations, stiffs his workers, draft-dodger, mocks the handicapped, mocks POWs and Gold Star families, calls Nazi's VERY FINE PEOPLE, puts toddlers in jail, what else,https://,twitter.com/LuluLZL/status,/1020061535836753920, ,…",BrianRFriedman,,https://twitter.com/BrianRFriedman/status/1020062769314484224,1532036890
"Wrong on every account. 1]Did not mock reporter-used same gesture for many (google tape) 2)Very fine people was a reference to other people present- regular people like you & me.  Saw them interviewd - google also.  3)Obama separated families first - 89,000 + lawsuit.  Judge Gee",LuluLZL,BrianRFriedman,https://twitter.com/LuluLZL/status/1020064711705022465,1532037353
"1.) he mentioned the reporter by name as he made the gesture 2.) don't tell me what i heard with my own ears, and 3.)and Obama ENDED the practice.",BrianRFriedman,LuluLZL,https://twitter.com/BrianRFriedman/status/1020065129277292544,1532037453
"1) From a piece of paper. Not in person. 3) Obama still did it first. Lawsuit due to horrendous conditions ended it.  

And FYI - When Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in the 80's he sued the City Of Palm Beach to allow Blacks & Jews membership.  No racist would do that.  Public record.",LuluLZL,BrianRFriedman,https://twitter.com/LuluLZL/status/1020066877345853447,1532037870

"First of all, the central point in the original tweet stands. 

If you have to go back to the 1860s or even the 1960s to claim the ""party of civil rights"" mantle -- while ignoring legislative votes and executive actions taken in *this* decade -- you're clearly grasping at straws.",KevinMKruse,,https://twitter.com/KevinMKruse/status/1022886357360947200,1532710086
"Second, this fact -- that GOP votes were needed to overcome the opposition of Southerners in Congress (Democrats *and* Republicans) -- is weirdly trotted out as if it's a hidden secret and not, you know, a central part of historians' narrative of the civil rights era.",KevinMKruse,,https://twitter.com/KevinMKruse/status/1022886358459854848,1532710086
"This is a constant thing with D'Souza, by the way, claiming ""historians won't tell you this"" or ""they don't lecture about that"" when, in fact, we do constantly.

"Anyway, let's dig in to the talking point.

Yes, a higher proportion of Republicans *did* vote for the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. Yes, their votes were crucial to passage of each.

But they were junior partners in the process, and soon marginalized in their party.",KevinMKruse,,https://twitter.com/KevinMKruse/status/1022886361177776128,1532710087
"Worth remembering how Congress looked:

In 1964, Dems had nearly a 2-to-1 margin in the House (258 D, 176 R); in 1965, more than a 2-to-1 margin (295 D, 140 R).

In 1964, Dems had nearly a 2-to-1 margin in the Senate (64 D, 36 R); in 1965, more than a 2-to-1 margin (68 D, 32 R).",KevinMKruse,,https://twitter.com/KevinMKruse/status/1022886362889035778,1532710087
"Democrats were the dominant party, but had become increasingly divided over civil rights, with northern white liberals and African-Americans steadily gaining on the southern conservative segregationists who had long controlled the party.

"On the flip side, yes, liberal and moderate Republicans did side with the majority of Democrats to pass the bills, after Dem leaders recruited them.

"This is ludicrous. 

At the time, conservatives were engaged in civil war with these liberals and moderates, trying to drive them out of the Republican Party.

At the 1964 RNC, Nelson Rockefeller called out extremists in the GOP and was roundly booed:,https://www.,youtube.com/watch?v=whjyvq,toDrA, ,…",KevinMKruse,,https://twitter.com/KevinMKruse/status/1022886379020328968,1532710091

"Over time, conservatives succeeded in cementing a new identity for the GOP, with civil rights increasingly becoming a major distinction.

This was evident in public polling at the time. 

In 1964, only 7% saw the GOP as better on civil rights. SEVEN. PERCENT.

"The change was equally clear in the GOP platforms: 

In 1960, a lengthy, detailed section on civil rights.
In 1964, only a few lines.

"So, no, the GOP was not ""the party of civil rights"" in the 1960s.

There were, to be sure, moderates in the GOP like Romney and Rockefeller who stood up for civil rights.

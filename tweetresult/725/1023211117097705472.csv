"I came to a realization recently.  I recognize the left continues to talk about race abt everything, while the right could care less what color you are.  We know melanin levels are out of EVERYONE’s control.  It’s as irrelevant as your height.

"PLenty of white people have never been racists in the first place and since the beginning of America. It's not a white vs black thing. It has never been. It has always been a Democrat vs Republican thing.

"Let's talk about this Washington Post article looking at southern white evangelicals who still support Trump:,https://www.,washingtonpost.com/news/national/,wp/2018/07/21/feature/god-trump-and-the-meaning-of-morality/?utm_term=.eae1190403b4, ,…",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021157469287059457,1532297887
"1. Overall, it's a pretty good piece. It's respectful to the church-goers, tries to understand them without making them anthropological exhibits.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021157833457524736,1532297974
"2. It's also a step up from the usual ""Yup, Trump dead-enders are still with Trump"" pieces because it tries to answer that vexing question: WTF, evangelicals? You're going with THAT sinner?",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021158173913362432,1532298055
"3. I mean, head-on! It's framed by a preacher who's very nervous about preaching on adultery in the age of Trump! (He chickens out.)",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021158468072427520,1532298125
"4. One last general thing: it's a good reminder that white support for Trump is *uneven.* In the rural South, you might be hard-pressed to find a white man who doesn't approve of Trump. Up here in Wisconsin, not so much. (Though admittedly, more than I'd like.)",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021159056554291202,1532298265
"5. In any case, if you've ever wondered how Trump can keep such high ratings among Chrisitans/white Christians, that's why. Sky-high support some places, not so bigly elsewhere.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021159290910986241,1532298321
"6. Now, let's get down to specifics. Many people have noticed this part:,pic.twitter.com/Ix2MvRWMBd",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021159534872711168,1532298379
"7. It's easy enough to look at that and wonder what in the living aitch-ee-double-toothpicks people are thinking. How can a professed Christian be so dumb, so scripturally ignorant?",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021160189779750912,1532298536
"8. The answer is that it's not ignorance, it's pride. And by pride, I don't mean arrogance, but something almost altogether different.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021160542407479296,1532298620
"9. Reinhold Niebuhr (originator of the Serenity prayer, every politician's favorite theologian, from the same branch of Protestantism as me) thought pride was the original sin, which is a pretty conventional view.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021161011619991552,1532298732
"10. But Niebuhr's definition of pride was anything but conventional. Yes, there's stupid wilfulness, he said, but more importantly, we refuse to acknowledge that we have limited information.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021161405960130560,1532298826
"11. As Niebuhr says (and I never tire of repeating), *what* we know is largely contingent on *who* we know. Our social connections condition both how much we know, and how we interpret that knowledge.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021161757124022273,1532298909
"12. It's no surprise to hear the grandmas in this piece spout insane conspiracy theories. (Obama carried a Koran with him? Seriously?) They live in a very small world, with more than likely only a very small list of news outlets they'll pay attention to.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021162232963616769,1532299023
"13. It's not that they're incapable of seeing a larger world. You'd be surprised how intelligent some ignoramuses can be. But ""their people"" see the world through a particular lens, and they choose to do so as well.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021162601701683200,1532299111
14. That's that Fox News bubble we all hear about. It's not brainwashing people; it's reinforcing what their in-group wants to hear. And what that in-group wants to hear is that it's under attack.,pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021163069559443457,1532299222
"15. Or more precisely, what that in-group wants to hear is that they're under attack, but with a brave new leader to protect them!",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021163327588794368,1532299284
"16. Again, no accident that the ghosts of the Civil Rights Era pop up in this piece. The shriveled, diseased heart of Christian American pride is the refusal to give up its place of privilege.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021163661962956801,1532299363
"17. White privilege, cis-het privilege, middle-class privilege, you name it. Trump's convinced these people that they FINALLY have a president who's on their side. 

Their pride is their inability to critique that conviction.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021164322964242437,1532299521
"18. You can see the folks in the article struggle with the cognitive dissonance this creates. They talk about Trump getting framed by liberals, they talk about Satan the father of lies. They recognize their own rationalizations.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021165042501398528,1532299693
19. But they still stick with Trump. Why? Because the group is more important than their doubts.,pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021165351961350145,1532299766
"20. If you put personal knowledge up against the ideology of your social group, the personal knowledge is going to lose. Every g-d time. Tribe is far more important to humans than reason.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021165678638911489,1532299844
"21. That's what pride is, according to Niebuhr: the inability to interrogate our own moral stances because we're too committed to ideology.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021166190993932288,1532299966
"22. What makes it worse, according to Niebuhr, is the human capacity for ""partial self-transcendence."" That is, we're able to see how we can make things better, and tempted to think than means we can make them *good.*",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021166527624642561,1532300047
"23. In other words, humans know just enough to fool them into thinking they're not dumb. Big mistake. Big mistake.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021166760106610688,1532300102
"24. There's another strand here too, which is that our pride blinds us to the consequences of our actions, and so it's important to gather as many perspectives as we can in taking moral decisions.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021167460148563968,1532300269
"25. That's the piece of Niebuhr beloved by Obama, David Brooks, Hillary Clinton and many others. But it's incomplete.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021168113193226241,1532300425
"26. It's not just that elites have to ask a lot of questions. It's that (and here I'm extrapolating from Niebuhr) if humanity is ever going to ""approximate justice,"" multiple perspectives will have to penetrate one another.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021168512562270213,1532300520
"27. I'm not sure Niebuhr would have been a big fan of post-modernity, but in a way, his ethics necessitates it. Think about the classic post-colonialist question: how can you do justice for the indigenous if you don't talk to them?",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021168997038010373,1532300635
"28. Or to put things another way, American democracy can't survive if a bunch of people decide they'd rather be ignoramuses than consider things from somebody else's point of view.",pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021169384516177922,1532300728
29. Or if they decide their ideology is more important than hearing that they and their forebearers may have made mistakes.,pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021170043340709888,1532300885
30. Again: no accident that we hear the rehearsal of racial grievances from the white perspective. Part of the issue is that some folks don't want to wrestle with the idea that their parents were racist as shit.,pastordan,,https://twitter.com/pastordan/status/1021170348946001921,1532300958

I would argue it's not pride that is their problem. Its lack of humility. Humility is the insulin of pride. They have no humility keeping their pride regulated and in check.,BrimstoneAshe,pastordan,https://twitter.com/BrimstoneAshe/status/1023217464031805442,1532789028

For these people the only two planks in the trump platform that matter are still intact. He's not black and he's not a woman. For an insecure white man or the spouse of same the most insecure white man in the country being in the White House is very reassuring.,spathorton,"pastordan,emilyrue11",https://twitter.com/spathorton/status/1023263729646030849,1532800059

"I dunno who you are, but:

1) Get the fuck out of Chicago.
2) You are delusional. There are at least a dozen countries doing better than we are in the areas of education, healthcare, acceptance of other people.

Yet we kidnap kids, ban Muslims &  Mexicans, kill POC in the name of the law, tell athletes they don't have freedom of speech, make the rich richer, and the poor poorer.

"We've been involved in perpetual, expensive wars of aggression that threaten to bankrupt the republic -- ever since our ""birth of a Nation.""

You say our way of life is better.

Well sure it is. We don't get bombed every day by America.",feelthejeff,charliekirk11,https://twitter.com/feelthejeff/status/1022834524466626561,1532697728

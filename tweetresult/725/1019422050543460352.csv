There is no way you are asking me this in good faith. The man launched his star on birtherism and calling Mexicans rapists. He has been sued by the government for housing doscrimation. He is a darling or stormfront and David Duke. Support is supporting the entire package.,Ryan_Mourton,"weeeelolol,keepitNeal87",https://twitter.com/Ryan_Mourton/status/1019451654905782273,1531891189

"No, you haven't been paying attention. Enabling a racist is not much different than being racist and every Trump supporter enabled a racist and those who support him still do.

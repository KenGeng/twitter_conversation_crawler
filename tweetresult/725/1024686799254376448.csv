"The left says Senator Byrd stated that he was ""sorry"" and he ""repented"" his ways. So it's ok, almost like it didn't happen. Just ask yourself how long he was in the KKK.",chrisbarr24,"CombatDebater,realTylerZed",https://twitter.com/chrisbarr24/status/1024697663932035072,1533141935
Byrd was a recruiter for the KKK in his 20s and 30s. How many lynchings do you think he initiated or caused through his recruited members? That was at the highest membership in the Klan. I wouldn't accept any words from him given his despicable actions.,LegalMediaWire,"chrisbarr24,CombatDebater,realTylerZed",https://twitter.com/LegalMediaWire/status/1024709775735447552,1533144823

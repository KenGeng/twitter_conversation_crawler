"I love when ,#,Trumpflakes, use ""The Tolerant Left"" in an attempt to make people feel bad about not Tolerating bullshit. We Tolerate Religions, Sexuality, Gender, and personal opinions. What we dont tolerate is ,@,realDonaldTrump, and those like him who spread lies, hate, and evil.",GoodKingSolomon,,https://twitter.com/GoodKingSolomon/status/1022122876181204993,1532528058
"The left spreads lies and are filled with pure hatred. Leftists are racists and bigots. 
The only thing they do good is project their own hate, racism, and bigotry on others.",ScallywagPatri1,"GoodKingSolomon,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/ScallywagPatri1/status/1022124237492899841,1532528383
"1) look in a mirror
2) Bigotry requires religion, the term originally came from olde English ""by God"" bigotry in this nation mostly comes from the Evangelical Right 
3) you're doing quite a bit of projecting right now.",GoodKingSolomon,"ScallywagPatri1,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/GoodKingSolomon/status/1022135647476170754,1532531103
"
Bigotry meaning is intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself. 
Talk about projecting. Nobody has shown more hate than leftists. The Democratic party founded the KKK and no reason to think they don't support it still. Actions speak louder than words.",ScallywagPatri1,"GoodKingSolomon,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/ScallywagPatri1/status/1022200519429906432,1532546570
"So in your mind, tolerance means never disagreeing with anyone? Bigotry requires personal belief system that Inherently prejudices one against another, I have no idea what belief system you hold, your comments alone spoke volumes that I would debate wholeheartedly against.",GoodKingSolomon,"ScallywagPatri1,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/GoodKingSolomon/status/1022219517064171520,1532551099
"You claim to be a scholar but refused to read my proper text.  Bigotry is not disagreement. It is intolerance to those that disagree. Completely different. You misinterpreted my text in attempt to make yours better. 
Very common leftist tactic.",ScallywagPatri1,"GoodKingSolomon,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/ScallywagPatri1/status/1022229905172520960,1532553576
"It requires a specific belief system to be bigoted from, otherwise your definition means anyone who disagrees is a bigot. I disagree with you, not for who you are, because of what you've said, we have opposite opinions, that is not bigotry I am still tolerating your presence.",GoodKingSolomon,"ScallywagPatri1,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/GoodKingSolomon/status/1022234258276999168,1532554614
"A belief system is not required. An Uber driver kicked out black passengers for wearing MAGA hats. The left would play the race card in that situation, but the truth is the driver was a severe bigot. Possibly a racist, but more info needs to be presented before going there.",ScallywagPatri1,"GoodKingSolomon,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/ScallywagPatri1/status/1022476259987738624,1532612311
"Pretty sure wearing a MAGA hat isn't a race. Betcha they wouldn't have gotten kicked out if they weren't wearing the hat.

But either way. Do businesses not have the right to refuse service to anyone? Did you not cheer the Scotus decision on the cake baker?",GoodKingSolomon,"ScallywagPatri1,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/GoodKingSolomon/status/1022477792674377730,1532612677
"Kind of like this? Lol.

Most of these people are loud as fuck and as lacking in reality as it gets. Then suddenly others fight back and their brain explodes in a state of endless confusion.

I care about people which is why I'm intolerant of those who don't.

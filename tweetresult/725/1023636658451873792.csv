The vandalism at Congregation Shaarey Tefilla goes well beyond a petty crime. It was a hateful act of antisemitism that goes against everything America stands for. 1/2,SenToddYoung,,https://twitter.com/SenToddYoung/status/1023636658451873792,1532888972

That's quite a tactic.
I mean, don't bother addressing a single thing I *actually said. Just make some stuff up to deflect from having to defend your claims or respond to mine. That should work.

P.P:. Yeah. So what? People change. I did too. There's nothing 'racist'  ~this. 
C.P.5.: Trump never referred to their race. He said; ""They admitted they were guilty..."". That isn't 'racist'. *You are making it about race.

This is what happens when the GOP joined forces with the white nationalists to elect a known racist President. Overt racism is prevalent because Trump openly espouses hate and racist beliefs.

America has always stood for white supremacy and the ruling class profiting off of the blood and sweat of a lower class.

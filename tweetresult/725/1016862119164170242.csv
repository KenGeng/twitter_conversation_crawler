"I know it's confusing, but you do realize that the parties switched ideologies, so that in that era the repubs were dems and the dems were repubs, right?",mooielouie,Sephito,https://twitter.com/mooielouie/status/1018610940844134400,1531690747

Except untill the early 1900s the Republicans we're the Liberal party and Democrats the Conservative party. So what's that mean?  Liberals 100% approved the ban on slavery.,DragonAcid16,Sephito,https://twitter.com/DragonAcid16/status/1019379683782156288,1531874030

"This is always the case and has been, but the public schools hide it from everybody! They say that the party of Lincoln (Republican) somehow changed, but it never did...it is still the party of the people! Then look at the dems history + see what you see. They still are the same!",CullanCrothers,Sephito,https://twitter.com/CullanCrothers/status/1018948136553807874,1531771141
"Thank you, Chapin. The leftists today all say the Democrats changed for ""the good"" in the 1960s by the creation of the Welfare systems. Nope!

"Yeah, that's when the Democrats were the conservative party, not liberal. What they believed in in 1865 is not the same as what Democrats believe in today.

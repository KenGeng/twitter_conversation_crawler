The so called millions of votes came from California. If you did not have the Electorial College a single state could decide who became President. We have the same problem in Canada.

The DNC had such little respect for the people that they chose a candidate very few liked because she is a woman. She had such disregard for the people she didn't even campaign in the right states.

I’m still amused by how many people said Josh Hader got a standing ovation as a show of “support and forgiveness”. So like...white people “forgiving” a white guy for being racist. How does that make sense to anyone? Lol,primediscussion,,https://twitter.com/primediscussion/status/1021351153131548672,1532344065

"Wow. That’s a negative way to think of people. It must suck to see the world that way. People change daily. Just cause you make a few bad choices growing up, doesn’t mean he/she will make them bad choices till they die.",bigrv916,"strat_nick,primediscussion,nynole55",https://twitter.com/bigrv916/status/1021427476222959617,1532362262
"Are you saying that tweeting was a bad choice or that being racist in the first place was a bad choice?

I don’t agree that being racist is a “choice,” I think it’s a conditioned worldview that poisons how you view everything.",strat_nick,"bigrv916,primediscussion,nynole55",https://twitter.com/strat_nick/status/1021429736285921280,1532362801
Yes and yes. He didn’t have a choice in how and where he was raised. But he does have a choice to grow and learn as he experiences more of the world around him and learns from it. So you believe in no free will?,bigrv916,"strat_nick,primediscussion,nynole55",https://twitter.com/bigrv916/status/1021431214958415872,1532363153
"I do believe in free will, I just don’t believe that a vast majority of people change their views on race from the age of 17. That’s less than one year from being old enough to vote.

That means he felt this way after being taught about the history of slavery, segregation, etc.",strat_nick,"bigrv916,primediscussion,nynole55",https://twitter.com/strat_nick/status/1021433043175772160,1532363589
the lengths whiteness in this country will go to avoid talking about racism is both infuriating and jaw dropping.,SprtsGamer,primediscussion,https://twitter.com/SprtsGamer/status/1021360654870032384,1532346330

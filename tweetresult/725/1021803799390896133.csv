"He made lots of ""jokes"".  Real funny ones too.  I still have to stand at the urinal when I hear the ""Three men and a baby they just had sex with"" to keep from pissing myself.

Absolutely NOT defending him. Only making a comment on some differences between the Gunn situation and the Barr one. At the end of the day only looking at a sliver of the whole picture... certainly don't know these folks personally.,idubbs,staceydash,https://twitter.com/idubbs/status/1021807024450011136,1532452753

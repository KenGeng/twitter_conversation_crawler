i just want to say when i went to this HIGHLY SECLUDED place it was almost 4:45 am and i ran into two nightborne elves there who were roleplaying there.......the grind never stops,420jimins,,https://twitter.com/420jimins/status/1024330604492480512,1533054421
i got too close to them bc i was trying to see if they were afk or not & i had my nameplate set to IC on accident and one of them glanced over at me (in emote) and i was too high so i just absconded out of there,420jimins,,https://twitter.com/420jimins/status/1024331448554217472,1533054623

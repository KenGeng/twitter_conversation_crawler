Reactions to vaccines are completely different than claiming people develop autism from them. Autism is developed through genetics. There is no viable proof that vaccines have any part.

"The most simple to explain is that vaccines can cause an autoimmune reaction, that causes brain inflammation, which left untreated can cause brain injury, which causes the behaviors of autism, which earns a child a ""autism"" diagnosis.",GingerTaylor,"GingerTaylor,Glummy9",https://twitter.com/GingerTaylor/status/1025139601860702214,1533247301
"Another involves a set of MTHFR mutations that cause impaired methylation, which results in low gluthione, which the body needs to process out toxins.

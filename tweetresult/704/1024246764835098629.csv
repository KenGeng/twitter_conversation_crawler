"It's alright to argue from facts against absurd hypothesis; but it's fallacious to invent a hypothesis & argue against the facts. That's not even real science.

"Nice meaningless rant. Please explain how these observable facts are possible on your flat plane. Thanks.,pic.twitter.com/36fWtnexVm",whoopsbuni,Vortexpuppy1,https://twitter.com/whoopsbuni/status/1024258237607145472,1533037168
Natural Science is about demonstrable practical examples. So you think water bends? Then demonstrate it you fool otherwise you are just a liar. Images and looking at they sky are not measurable proof of Terra Firma. Now please do your job better and reply with some more BS. lol,Vortexpuppy1,whoopsbuni,https://twitter.com/Vortexpuppy1/status/1024275094691094528,1533041187
Now this is nonsense. Haven’t you ever been on a long haul flight? They easily go high enough to see it.,DannyHirst,"Vortexpuppy1,whoopsbuni",https://twitter.com/DannyHirst/status/1024278052933709825,1533041892
So images prove that water can bend? Can you provide practical examples of water conforming to the exterior of a shape or stick to a ball?,Vortexpuppy1,"DannyHirst,whoopsbuni",https://twitter.com/Vortexpuppy1/status/1024279145591840768,1533042153
"Yes if it was easy to recreate gravity around a golf ball, the water density could be drawn to coat it. I’m not talking about images, try looking out of the window.",DannyHirst,"Vortexpuppy1,whoopsbuni",https://twitter.com/DannyHirst/status/1024280127755182080,1533042387
lol. You deny common sense in real life (water cannot bend) but entertain absurdities in theories? Sad. I've flown many times and no curve to be seen because there isn't one. So tell me again how billions of tons of standing water bend? Grabbity? EinSchtickStein?,Vortexpuppy1,"DannyHirst,whoopsbuni",https://twitter.com/Vortexpuppy1/status/1024281929238175746,1533042816
"You are demonstrating a superb level of ultracrepidarianism. 35 cameras were used on the Felix Baumgartner flight, including a head cam. I suggest you watch it from start to finish, so that you can avoid looking more foolish on social media at the earliest opportunity.",DannyHirst,"Vortexpuppy1,whoopsbuni",https://twitter.com/DannyHirst/status/1024284357429796864,1533043395
Haha. You are displaying UltraCrapDelusionism. FYI Maths & Physics is my expertise. Do you really accept images and movies as proof of natural scientific phenomena? If so I have some Unicorns and fairies playing with Nessie in my back garden. Believe me. I'll show you some images,Vortexpuppy1,"DannyHirst,whoopsbuni",https://twitter.com/Vortexpuppy1/status/1024286692163891200,1533043952

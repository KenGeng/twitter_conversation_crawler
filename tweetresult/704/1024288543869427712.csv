"lemme get even more controversial. bigfoot and loch ness monster are less interesting than a lot of animals we know actually exist and live on our planet, like basically anything in the abyssal deep sea",splendidland,olivebrinker,https://twitter.com/splendidland/status/1024290746264899585,1533044918

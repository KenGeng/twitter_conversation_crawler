Is the moon landing a hoax??? I’m starting to believe that now,Marshall5Sharon,,https://twitter.com/Marshall5Sharon/status/1024589787397861376,1533116215
It was staged by the Loch Ness monster,daft_old_cat,Marshall5Sharon,https://twitter.com/daft_old_cat/status/1024590216470904833,1533116318

I'm replying on a hand held device that has more technology that what them rockets had so surely we should be going on a regular basis now,nopenothappy,Marshall5Sharon,https://twitter.com/nopenothappy/status/1024598301579067392,1533118245
Good point,Marshall5Sharon,nopenothappy,https://twitter.com/Marshall5Sharon/status/1024606134886391808,1533120113
It is. Flags don’t fly on the moon + none of the astronauts spoke of it and for the yanks to have one over on Russia. So yes. Probably is fake on that basis.,TrueblueBritish,Marshall5Sharon,https://twitter.com/TrueblueBritish/status/1024594461442166784,1533117330
Buzz admitted on an old video he didn’t land on the moon then said he was misinterpreted,Marshall5Sharon,TrueblueBritish,https://twitter.com/Marshall5Sharon/status/1024594807962972160,1533117412
Load of bollocks it was. Aeronautical technology they’d need for Galatian travel could not have existed in the 60s. The plane had only been created 50 years prior to it.,TrueblueBritish,Marshall5Sharon,https://twitter.com/TrueblueBritish/status/1024595272649900033,1533117523
My dad always thought so,Nick_Pye,Marshall5Sharon,https://twitter.com/Nick_Pye/status/1024595434096996352,1533117562
What do you think? The flag movement is a giveaway lol,Marshall5Sharon,Nick_Pye,https://twitter.com/Marshall5Sharon/status/1024595610912124928,1533117604
Maybe,Nick_Pye,Marshall5Sharon,https://twitter.com/Nick_Pye/status/1024596284710309890,1533117765

"Ive said that for years now, if they can send a rover to Mars why have there not been more moon landings?x",Goggs4,Marshall5Sharon,https://twitter.com/Goggs4/status/1024912661899816961,1533193195

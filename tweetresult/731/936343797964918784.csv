I just wonder where the positive trade off is? Replacing gas stations with charging stations. The massive amount of electrical infrastructure  that will need to be built. The supply cant keep up with demand now. Think increased rolling brownouts and blackouts. Makes no sense.,ajsimmonsphoto,,https://twitter.com/ajsimmonsphoto/status/936792202801332224,1512183640

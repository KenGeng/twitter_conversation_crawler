"Disgraceful that households should be paying large corporates not to use power because a mismanaged power system can't produce enough for everyone,http://www.,theaustralian.com.au/business/minin,g-energy/big-energy-users-act-to-save-the-grid-from-blackouts-over-summer/news-story/0b422fc11eb362a32384bf2ef5bb5c9b, ,…",GrahamY,,https://twitter.com/GrahamY/status/949032451757678592,1515101943
The sooner we all go off-grid with solar-storage the better. All the energy leeches will then be left to their own devices (deservedly).,GeochemOz,"GrahamY,DavidLeyonhjelm",https://twitter.com/GeochemOz/status/949049776292507649,1515106073
That ain't going to work. Unless you are planning on a diesel generator in every backyard.,GrahamY,"GeochemOz,DavidLeyonhjelm",https://twitter.com/GrahamY/status/949058788799082498,1515108222
"It will work just fine, except for the people who have opted (or been forced into) the high-rise life.

"Rationing. Now watch them start talking like they are our energy saviours,  like they didn't create the problem in the first place. Maybe they can even pitch it as a failure of the free market or because of a lack of regulation. Numpties.",willyjtaylor,GrahamY,https://twitter.com/willyjtaylor/status/949051993330339840,1515106602
Yes. That's why it's important to try to get in first.  Might be worth reminding Malcolm Turnbull that more than anything else Menzies won the 1949 election on petrol rationing.,GrahamY,willyjtaylor,https://twitter.com/GrahamY/status/949058478609330176,1515108148
Just read that and thought what an indictment on our policy makers,nick_thyme,GrahamY,https://twitter.com/nick_thyme/status/949033162264363008,1515102112
Absolutely. And did you notice the size of the payments is confidential. So we don't even have an informed market.,GrahamY,nick_thyme,https://twitter.com/GrahamY/status/949034078841421824,1515102331
Notice it doesn't say Qld in part because your lot (the LNP) weren't allowed to sell our power assets - because Qlders are smarter than you thought - but you still want to sell them?,qldpolicy,GrahamY,https://twitter.com/qldpolicy/status/949116771071492096,1515122046
"Too many immigrants thisl year with no infrastructure upgrades makes for trouble. Though this government are happy bringing us to our knees, giving jobs to foreigners, allowing banks to rort the public for decades suits their plan.",karoolatas,GrahamY,https://twitter.com/karoolatas/status/949108764191334400,1515120137

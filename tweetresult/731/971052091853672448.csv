"Bill Nye brings up Kinder Morgan pipeline - references a website that says Canada could be powered by renewable energy right now. “Tell us about that,” Nye tells Trudeau.

Trudeau says his govt is investing in alternatives to fossil fuels, but “we’re in a transition.”",l_stone,,https://twitter.com/l_stone/status/971052091853672448,1520351834

Canada is a vast cold country.  To live we need to keep our houses warm by burning fossil fuels and eat food trucked across long distances.  Canada will always emit more “carbon pollution” per capita.

Since we're so covered by trees and plants witj a population so spread out we also absorb all the C02 we put out already.

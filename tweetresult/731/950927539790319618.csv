"What are the steps needed to ditch carbon and live better, kids really need this information from leaders like you. Tell how to do it.",DailyRasp,"climatebabes,Breeze_CA,CAGWSkeptic",https://twitter.com/DailyRasp/status/951342383035068416,1515652673
"Create little islands of fossil fuel independence. You can achieve that primarily by investing in renewables, which also increases the political power of RE companies, and reduces the need for fossil fuels. Foster and grow those islands of independence and the rest follows.",climatebabes,"DailyRasp,Breeze_CA,CAGWSkeptic",https://twitter.com/climatebabes/status/951613236918538241,1515717250
"Interesting idea. These ""little islands of fossil fuel independence"" as you call them, could just do a separate economy outside of ""our"" regular economy and by repeating over and over more of it will be wanted by the people, that's what you mean, correct?",DailyRasp,"climatebabes,Breeze_CA,CAGWSkeptic",https://twitter.com/DailyRasp/status/951641462487203845,1515723979
"You're ""done with carbon""? What the hell do you eat, and did you stop breathing? Where do you live? More important, how can you be this stupid?",Cris_Paunescu,climatebabes,https://twitter.com/Cris_Paunescu/status/951605749649690624,1515715465
"You are the one who is stupid. There are clear alternatives for fossil fuels in farming, so why would you accept a day more of dependence on a resource that is so damaging. Those wildfires and droughts mean less food reserves..",climatebabes,Cris_Paunescu,https://twitter.com/climatebabes/status/951615247948959744,1515717729
"1st, name ONE. 2nd, wildfires and draughts are on the decline (also see California arsonist). 3rd, food production has dramatically increased. And last, no, you are.",Cris_Paunescu,climatebabes,https://twitter.com/Cris_Paunescu/status/951633831798476800,1515722160

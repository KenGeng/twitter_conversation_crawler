"Without natural access to vast hydroelectric storage, Germany has had to roll back its climate targets.
If world-leading Germany can't do it, who can?
British Columbia can, with ,#,siteC,http://www.,climatechangenews.com/2018/01/08/ger,many-set-abandon-2020-climate-target-reports/, ,…",ChrisAikman2,,https://twitter.com/ChrisAikman2/status/950502833199001600,1515452509
"Don't need ,#,sitec, . ,@,bchydro, has all the legacy reservoir capacity needed to support any demand increases that materialize. We have surplus capacity now and are paying IPPs not to produce. No need to pile on >$12B debt for power we don't need.",bob_fedderly,ChrisAikman2,https://twitter.com/bob_fedderly/status/950508554024177664,1515453873
"Bob, I accept you don't need it. 
But don't speak for the rest of the world.
The world needs energy, and we have a lot of hydrocarbon energy to replace. It's technically, environmentally & economically wise to do so.

"Transmission losses from far away from load projects need to be factored in. Why waste energy when it can be produced at load centre? You can only control what happens in BC. ,#,sitec, is not the answer.",bob_fedderly,"ChrisAikman2,bchydro",https://twitter.com/bob_fedderly/status/950550669898924032,1515463914
"Bob, solarPV will be produced locally - no losses.
But that won't happen unless 24/7/365 power is assured.
Availability as needed is fossil energy's best virtue. 
Electricity can do that too, with ,#,siteC,.",ChrisAikman2,"bob_fedderly,bchydro",https://twitter.com/ChrisAikman2/status/950564462137819136,1515467203
"Respectfully, we have more than enough reservoirs for backup of your locally produced power without ,#,sitec,. Remembering that the project would be only ~9% of total capacity or less if you use the higher legacy  capacity number rather than the ones used to push the project.",bob_fedderly,"ChrisAikman2,bchydro",https://twitter.com/bob_fedderly/status/950566207958106114,1515467619
"You are ignoring the impact of versatility added to upstream generation, where 30% of BC's electricity presently comes from.
Their ability to supply on-demand becomes awesome with ,#,siteC,.",ChrisAikman2,"bob_fedderly,bchydro",https://twitter.com/ChrisAikman2/status/950576751687561216,1515470133
"The ""versatility"" exists. Both upstream facilities have wicket gate controls for virtually infinite fine tuning of output. They are on demand facilities now. No need for ,#,sitec, reservoir and the associated debt, enviro damage or rate shock.",bob_fedderly,"ChrisAikman2,bchydro",https://twitter.com/bob_fedderly/status/950583629171777537,1515471772
"Have you thought through the degree of flood & drought implied by your imagined 'infinite tuning'?
,#,SiteC, avoids downstream flood/drought.
With wind & solar, the dynamic range on the grid will be much larger than at present. It can't be matched with a single reservoir.",ChrisAikman2,"bob_fedderly,bchydro",https://twitter.com/ChrisAikman2/status/950585710716764160,1515472269

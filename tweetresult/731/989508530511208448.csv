"Does the bill touch on who will have the right to access the private data generated by Electric/Autonomous vehicles im thinking Location, Speed, Time, Date and who’s driving. I can see a future where insurance companies and government bodies will want/demand access to this data",cornsie,bobbyllew,https://twitter.com/cornsie/status/989513994208796672,1524753495

It’s good that alternative fuel sources are coming but we are a long way from there yet. I’m worried that we will push too fast and end up with environmental disaster later with end of life batteries 10 yr old cars only fit to scrap and not enough green energy 1/2,andyt5678,bobbyllew,https://twitter.com/andyt5678/status/989522157645557760,1524755441
"Checkout Mr ,@,bobbyllew, s ,@,FullyChargedShw, channel explaining battery life, 2nd uses after cars and the RECYCLING of components into New batteries. There are Nissan Leaf taxis doing still 90% efficiency after 250,000 miles (see ,@,candctaxis, in St Austell for example)",The_PlugSeeker,"andyt5678,bobbyllew",https://twitter.com/The_PlugSeeker/status/989592983539474433,1524772327
We can’t afford to do the diesel is good then diesel is bad change of heart thing again. Personally I think hydrogen fuel cell is better and we can create hydrogen using solar/wind or tidal energy. So would we be better to skip battery cars and take the time to build hydro.,andyt5678,"The_PlugSeeker,bobbyllew",https://twitter.com/andyt5678/status/989598881523601411,1524773733
"Despite tonnes of EVs worldwide capable of 150-250 miles, and able to charge in ever quicker times (20-30 mins most). Newer 300kW chargers from ,@,Fastned, to be able to charge next generation of EVs in 8-15 mins. Hmm.Yeah think I’ll go gor Hydrogen , and Betamax too while I’m at it",The_PlugSeeker,"andyt5678,bobbyllew",https://twitter.com/The_PlugSeeker/status/989606421833666560,1524775531
But how is the electricity being generated to charge the EV? If we all went EV tomorrow the national grid couldn’t cope. We don’t generate enough electricity so we need new power station. What type? Where? This is what I’m saying. I agree we need eco it just needs a complete plan,andyt5678,"The_PlugSeeker,bobbyllew",https://twitter.com/andyt5678/status/989608403394809856,1524776004
"Not to mention, it’s not like we are all gonna have EVs tomorrow, they are steadily increasing but still 1-2% sales and still have to wait for existing ICE cars to die out. And micro generation with home Solar etc is moving in concert with uptake EVs, solar rapidly dropping price",The_PlugSeeker,"andyt5678,bobbyllew",https://twitter.com/The_PlugSeeker/status/989611093415944193,1524776645
Sigh. Whatever buddy. Your fixated on EV is the solution to all. It’s not. Nissan themselves say a 7kw charger takes 7.5 hours to charge a leaf. They don’t even quote a time from a socket. The solution is not simple and we don’t have it yet. We are just starting. Night.,andyt5678,"The_PlugSeeker,bobbyllew",https://twitter.com/andyt5678/status/989611732590104576,1524776797

2/2 creation. Don’t want to do the whole diesel generates less CO so recommend them only to realise later that diesel is causing even bigger health programs. The plans need to look 30+ years into the future and be realistic about the -ve’s of EV.

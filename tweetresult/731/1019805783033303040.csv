Oilsands not Tarsands!.  Look at the BP disaster - ocean drilling!  The world needs oil.  Us buying it from overseas and having it shipped across the oceans makes sense to you?

Like steel mills in Hamilton.  Asbestos mines in Quebec.  Not to mention the number of major Canadian cities that still flush their waste into their drinking water.

"Perhaps ""Impunity"" is a stretch.  It takes years (often decades) for approvals .  By using the phrase Tarsands, you've obviously drunk the koolaid.

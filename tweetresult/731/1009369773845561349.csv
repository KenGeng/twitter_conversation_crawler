"Hey ,@,SwarajyaMag, is electricity created without oil?

Someone said it rightly.. EVM is just transporting pollution from one place to another.. Solar and Wind is just miniscule percentage.

In the end consumption of oil would be greater, when accounting for transmission losses.",SatyoShivam,"SwarajyaMag,us3d19",https://twitter.com/SatyoShivam/status/1009375349313101824,1529488811
"Yes electric vehicles will not require oil as the batteries of these cars use lithium. Currently, China is the biggest supplier of lithium and new mines have been found in Zambia and other African countries.  Be hopeful.",us3d19,"SatyoShivam,SwarajyaMag",https://twitter.com/us3d19/status/1009379863386472448,1529489887
"Since when is Lithium is source of energy? , It is just one medium to 'store' electricity! It's different that it is more efficient and has less transmission losses.

The source of energy is still electricity.. lithium battery also gets charged by electricity.",SatyoShivam,"us3d19,SwarajyaMag",https://twitter.com/SatyoShivam/status/1009382454707343360,1529490505
"U r missing d point..d electricity used to charge d vehicle will not be imported from Saudi Arabia or other Islamic Countries. Thus, choking the very funds which are used to spread Wahabbism.",us3d19,"SatyoShivam,SwarajyaMag",https://twitter.com/us3d19/status/1009383946969157633,1529490861
"Where are you going to generate the electricity from?

Electricity is certainly not imported. Oil is still going to be imported in greater quantities to generate the electricity which charges your EMVs.

Mr Gupta.. please brush up your logic and Class 8th Physics ",SatyoShivam,"us3d19,SwarajyaMag",https://twitter.com/SatyoShivam/status/1009453981054070784,1529507558
Electricity generation shall be from thermal powered stations which require coal as major source. No oil is used for electricity generation.,sirfsachordharm,"SatyoShivam,us3d19,SwarajyaMag",https://twitter.com/sirfsachordharm/status/1009482537440165888,1529514366
"Agree.

However, I am not sure if we can remove all oil and replace the humongous EMV electricity requirements just via thermal plants.. Think of pollution and ecological destruction with this scale of mining and CO2+methane emission. 

May god give good sense to our policymakers",SatyoShivam,"sirfsachordharm,us3d19,SwarajyaMag",https://twitter.com/SatyoShivam/status/1009800011905843200,1529590058
"I have not read a more incoherent article which is eons away from facts. Anybody who has done some hard numbers will laugh at the claims that EV’s will lead to drastic reduction in fuel demand and that too in a 10 year timeframe. Swarajya, do some numbers please.",abhishekprelog,"SwarajyaMag,us3d19",https://twitter.com/abhishekprelog/status/1009403090171072513,1529495425

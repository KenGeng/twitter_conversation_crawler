"Be safe! This needs to stop and this administration is at fault.  ,@,realDonaldTrump, you have caused a security concern for the press.

Simple solution - stop covering him. Nothing to report at his rallies - just a bunch of sound bites and lies.  His ridiculous base is going to believe him whether you are there or not.  Stop giving him attention & focus on the people who are smart enough to understand the news.,v_baltimo,AprilDRyan,https://twitter.com/v_baltimo/status/1024495296829476866,1533093687

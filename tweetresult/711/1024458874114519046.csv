"It’s interesting how every time an interviewer mentions to Kim K how her or husband support Trump she dances around it with statements like “Oh, we don’t support him! We just like his personality!” “He’s a kind man!”. It’s actually her still admitting they support him. Lmao.",HoodSocialist,,https://twitter.com/HoodSocialist/status/1024458874114519046,1533085003
Any person with sense can apply their context clues & just really listen to what she’s actually saying. She supports Trump when she dismisses whatever’s being said with “I don’t have anything bad to say” “we don’t support everything he does”. But y’all supporting him is ENOUGH!,HoodSocialist,,https://twitter.com/HoodSocialist/status/1024459360230105088,1533085119
They don’t have to go around saying “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” “BUILD THOSE WALLS!”. Endorsing a white supremacist is more than enough. Even Trump supporters know they support him. It’s usually her delusional stans still in denial. Lmao.,HoodSocialist,,https://twitter.com/HoodSocialist/status/1024460172381614080,1533085313

"Well... I'll write in more detail later, once I've *unpacked* the film. But I can say that this is Spike's best joint since his Michael Jackson documentary (""Bad 25""), 6 years ago. But maybe that isn't saying a lot when you consider his output over those half-dozen years.,https://,twitter.com/TambayObenson/,status/1024293712501850112, ,…",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024360392179503105,1533061523
"First impressions: I thought it was a tad too long, but Spike is notorious for dragging the running time of films past their expiration dates. For example - this is probably an unpopular opinion - but ""Bamboozled"" (2000) would be a classic if it were about 30 minutes shorter.,pic.twitter.com/T8jrHOUtRC",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024361642073759744,1533061821
"I read the book that the film is based on before seeing the film, and I can say that the film deviates quite a bit from the book. But that should be expected at this point, given how often Hollywood film adaptations of books differ from their source material.

"21st Century Spike Lee seems to do better work when he's not running the entire show; I.e., when he has to answer to a producer and exec producer that are not himself; and when he's not entirely responsible for the script.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024365123446730752,1533062651
"In the case of sub-par films like ""Red Hook Summer"" and ""Da Sweet Blood of Jesus,"" Spike wrote (or co-wrote) the scripts, and produced the films. These were *independent* productions on which he had really no supervision. He was able to do whatever he wanted with each.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024365642907111424,1533062775
"#,BlacKkKlansman, is ultimately a studio picture, with Jordan Peele & 
Jason Blum (of Blumhouse Prods, responsible for ""Get Out"") producing, and Spike working with 3 other writers to pen the script. So, like ""Inside Man,"" this is another Spike joint that's not entirely his own.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024367444058624000,1533063205
"It's an anti-trump film. Throughout, Spike makes that very clear. The conversation today is how the far right (Nazis, the KKK, etc) strives to re-package themselves with a more congenial presentation: Brooks Brothers suits, seemingly snowflaky ideals, etc. See Richard Spencer.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024370125938548739,1533063844
"But, as the film (and book) points out, white supremacists like David Duke had these ideals, and have been working towards a *normalization* of white supremacist ideology since the 1970s, in very much the same way as the so-called ""alt-right"" is attempting to do today,",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024370869005680640,1533064021
"The incendiary ""Birth of a Nation"" & its influence are referenced a bit, if only to provide some context, given the period the film takes place (70s). It's a film about the infiltration of the KKK after all & BOAN played a part in winning wide public acceptance"" of the KKK.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024373135389417472,1533064562
"Several Trumpisms are recycled: ""America First,"" ""Make America Great Again,"" etc, reminding the audience that Trump isn't some novelty. He's really a culmination of a long-standing attempt by various white supremacists groups in America to influence the socio-political landscape.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024375385679704064,1533065098
"The weakest link in the film is probably model/actress Laura Harrier as this young Angela Davis prototype/romantic interest (who doesn't exist in the book.) for John David Washington's Ron Stallworth lead character.,pic.twitter.com/zgq3liMa3K",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024376818646822912,1533065440
"I appreciate Spike wanting to include a black woman in the narrative on what is effectively a struggle for black liberation, but the actress just isn't convincing enough, and I kept wondering why he cast her, and if there was a stronger actress who would've excelled in the role.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024377266950889472,1533065547
"One last thing before I shut up... I would like to see a contemporary film that depicts the KKK as the truly  sinister organization that they were for a lot of black folks during the Klan's heyday. Recent films tend to portray them as clownish, buffoonish, which is all good...",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024378198916837381,1533065769
"BUT... there was a time when the KKK were indeed a true, organized menace for black people in America, and not the bumbling idiots that films of today tend to depict them as. We love those latter humorous day portrayals, but for our ancestors, they were something else entirely.",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024378877395779584,1533065931
"By the way, there's a cameo by a revered black actor, but I won't spoil it. Just look for a scene in which the story of Jesse Washington - a black teen who was brutally killed in 1916, in TX - is told. I tweeted about that lynching a while ago. It was truly savage. Google it!,pic.twitter.com/ipdxSouut0",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024381190978117633,1533066482
"Ah... one more thing... this is maybe the only Spike Lee film without a running soundtrack throughout. It's practically a Spike staple. I'm not sure if others who've seen the film, noticed, but I haven't seen any reviews or tweets that mention this. Alright, that's all for now.,pic.twitter.com/5DZAnNXmCv",TambayObenson,,https://twitter.com/TambayObenson/status/1024382754790760448,1533066855

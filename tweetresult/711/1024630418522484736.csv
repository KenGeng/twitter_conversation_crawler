Why do you need the media for that. Do you listen to what actually comes out of his mouth? He is vile. Those who blame the media must have selective hearing Trump only cares about how many people show up at his pep rallies.

So the media is just supposed to sit back and not challenge the continual lies to simple facts and statistical history.  You seem very intelligent but people who share your opinion should@turn the tv off and research and read.

I have a black friend in New Orleans who says since Trump the outright racist comments she gets day in day out are relentless. She says this is a direct result of Trump.

Racist people are awful. Most everyone agrees with this precept if you accept belief that racism is limited to bigotry directed at other races by white people. Identity politics & death of civility have created far more racial division & vitriol in past decade than dipshit Trump.,bigangrylaw,"PattyArquette,BennettVarsho",https://twitter.com/bigangrylaw/status/1025028796481785856,1533220883

No. It’s a word that describes positions designed to divide instead of unite. There is systemic disparity. I did thesis at Harvard on the systemic bigotry of the War on Drugs. I’m all for conversations. I’m all for identifying problems and fixing things but not dishonest vitriol.,bigangrylaw,"PattyArquette,BennettVarsho",https://twitter.com/bigangrylaw/status/1025067104083558401,1533230017

Racism has been around a long time. I have experienced it many times in my life. There is racism from every race against other races. It doesn’t mean every person is a racist or that one leader is the cause of global racism either.

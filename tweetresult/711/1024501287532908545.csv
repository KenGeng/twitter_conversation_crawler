"We don't. We scream racist when someone is a fucking racist.,https://,twitter.com/nytopinion/sta,tus/1024113230032134144, ,…",everywhereist,,https://twitter.com/everywhereist/status/1024501287532908545,1533095115
I gotta say I agree with her premise though.... thought it was a well laid out piece,BrynnBell,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/BrynnBell/status/1024510508693508096,1533097314
"The problem with her argument is that we’ve been taking breaths and listening for too long. Everyone needs to be held accountable for their thoughts and actions. When I said something racist and someone flat out said “that’s racist”, I learned.",5280library,"BrynnBell,everywhereist",https://twitter.com/5280library/status/1024642422146363392,1533128765
"I hear you, and I agree with you. I think it's important they know their actions/words are racist... I just think in most cases saying ""you're racist"" will just make them defensive and in the end not change their future behavior. It's a tough situation.",BrynnBell,"5280library,everywhereist",https://twitter.com/BrynnBell/status/1024665651116302336,1533134303
"I think if there is an accompanying explanation, then learning can happen. Yes, people will get defensive (I did and still do sometimes), but having a conversation is what’s important - I don’t remember the article suggesting conversation.",5280library,"BrynnBell,everywhereist",https://twitter.com/5280library/status/1024796787641475072,1533165568
"I agree somewhat but I am also very aware of the mob mentality. The fact that you state “we scream racist” is combative. In my work - we always use - collaboration, discussion, education, and outreach to fight it. Idk. Just my opinion.",Winter_4eveWilm,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/Winter_4eveWilm/status/1024609219675389955,1533120848
"Yeah, but the racists are getting to the point where they're gonna say racism is good, the way they're declaring collusion is cool.",kathleenhussein,"Winter_4eveWilm,everywhereist",https://twitter.com/kathleenhussein/status/1024615369170972673,1533122315
So if anyone has a world view that racism is okay then yes they need yelled at and called out.,martymoore3217,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/martymoore3217/status/1024506569801781248,1533096375

"in defense of ,@,nytopinion, (can't believe I just said that) I asked some questions of a Leftist/Democrat on Twitter. Tried my best to not be antagonistic and they accused me of wallowing in my white male privilege.

Uh. No. Making excuses for grandpa’s jokes and little sister’s blatant xenophobia is what lead us to this in the first place!  I’m done being polite. People need to be held accountable for their shitty behavior. Period.,alaskaknits172,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/alaskaknits172/status/1024540602082316289,1533104489

"In some ways, I agree with the author. She stated (if anyone bothered to read the article) that we are comfortable with the familiar and uncomfortable with the unfamiliar. White people have assumptions about black people just like black people have assumptions about  white people",Gem_mahwastaken,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/Gem_mahwastaken/status/1024696964032675840,1533141768
"No. Your statements are false equivalencies. White people are very familiar to us.
Knowing about you was/is necessary to our survival.

Yes. Why aren't there editorials asking people to stop being so fucking racist?,mbrockenbrough,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/mbrockenbrough/status/1024592546935308288,1533116873
"I used to think the old libertarian chestnut ""You can't just yell racism to win the argument"" meant ""That's not rhetorically sound. Prove me wrong."" But then I realized it REALLY means, ""Objectively racist policies aren't necessarily a deal-breaker, on our end.""",jaredlipof,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/jaredlipof/status/1024502034270179328,1533095293
Ok. The NY Times needs to STFU with some of its editorials lately. Great. A white lady wants to tell us all how to deal with racists and racism. Sit the F down.,demeritt,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/demeritt/status/1024529905592152064,1533101938

"I don't think screaming at people at all is the viable solution to ingrained tribalism as a result of Death Cult programming and isolationism. But, if you do, go for it. It is funny to watch.",messiconic,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/messiconic/status/1024518085259096064,1533099120
"Especially when someone is knowingly, openly, being racist. When they’re shouting it from the rooftops, we scream back.",brennan_meinke,everywhereist,https://twitter.com/brennan_meinke/status/1024677476969021440,1533137122
"I’m tired of this pushed narrative.. always pops up when a RW dbag says sumthing racist. Its the “what if she lies, it ruins a mans reputation”of helping racists avoid owning it.. I’m also tired of this charade that bc they thinly veil it the rest of us have 2 chalk it up as lulz",Unekone2gChris,"everywhereist,DirtyDucko",https://twitter.com/Unekone2gChris/status/1024637974095568897,1533127704

"I think that most people with racist, misogynistic or otherwised predjudiced attitudes do not actually examine WHY they hold those attitudes.

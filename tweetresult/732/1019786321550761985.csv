"Okay, poll results are in: I'mma talk about Suicide Squad until I forget how to type or until it gets to interesting to nitpick. Thanks for accompanying me on this journey. 

Also, I'mma have a beer for this, so you have a few minutes before I start.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019786321550761985,1531970980
"Okay, so first off, I have a brief observation. The DC Logo, the WB logo and whatever company that ""R"" represents in between them are all splattered with purples, greens and yellows and blues, as well as diamond patterns. This is making me think this'll be very Harley-centric",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019787831810568192,1531971340
"I guess, from what I've heard of the movie from other people, Margot Robbie is one of the best parts of this film; guess I'll find out.

Also, this isn't Margot's first time representing the character: her first Harley role was in the Family Guy: Quest for Stuff game in 2014.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019787832863289344,1531971340
"Okay, right into the movie.

Starts with The Animals' ""House of the Rising Sun"" which depending on how nerdy you are, is a bordello, a prison, a restaurant, a saloon, and/or a Coffee House.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019789881311035392,1531971829
"It's been claimed that the actual House of the Rising Sun is the Orleans Parish Women's Prison. So, since the movie begins in a blacksite prison, let's assume that our protags are being held in a women's prison. Surely that's why the song was chosen, right? Right.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019789882275663874,1531971829
"Also, that's a nice sign out front- I wonder if there's a talented artist guard or prisoner with access to the outside of the walls, and paints. Otherwise I have to believe that the prison hired some guy to paint it. On a blacksite.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019789883059998721,1531971829
"The bright side of the latter theory is that he likely got paid actual money for it, instead of doing it for exposure. Because, you know. Blacksite.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019789883999522816,1531971829
"Okay, so Deadshot's being held in a women's prison. Interesting to know.
Also, here's Margot Robbie. Theory confirmed. 

Also, here's another song. 3 minutes in, and two songs. Like, vocalized songs, not just background music. This seems excessive.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019790464940105728,1531971968
"That guard seems to be genuinely impressed that Harley Quinn is swinging around on the bars, and licking them and... whatever it is she's doing. He already knows she's bonkers, so why is he saying ""oh man lady, you're really damaged upstairs.""?

The audience can figure that out.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019792411776626688,1531972432
3:43: A third song. The Stones this time. Which is fine- I like me some stones.,ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019792412724453376,1531972432
"Okay, wait. WAIT. So, 2 Ford vehicles bweep their sirens and pull over in front of a building. Their lights aren't on, and they're not marked. How is anyone to know where the sirens are?  Also, who are they signalling? There seem to be just two.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019792413617897472,1531972432
"Amanda Waller steps out of one of the vehicles with another man, who's openly carrying what looks to be a *checks note* medium-sized submachinegun thing. So clearly security is high, right?",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019792414460948481,1531972433
Until she walks into a building that has a busker out front selling Superman Swag from behind a table. Did he get a background check? Why is he allowed to stay? Why aren't the men with guns staring him down? Did he give them discounts? Is this the guy that painted the blacksite?,ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019792415304003584,1531972433
"And title drop. This time it's very purple and blue with some gold highlights, not QUITE in keeping with the green/purple tints we saw earlier with the logos, but still close. Ish.

Also, with all the weapons around the Suicide Squad logo, I'm disappointed I see no boomerangs.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019793381700952064,1531972663
"Going back to the T-Shirt guy, maybe asking your audience to remember the last Superman movie(s) isn't the... best thing right now.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019793382623723521,1531972663
"The following scene is cut really strangely. Amanda walks in, sits down. Immediately Mackenzie (who I'll call Badges McMedals) says ""we lose a national hero, and you sit there looking like the cat that ate the canary."" ""I've eaten a lot of canaries."" Amanda replies.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796559515475970,1531973421
"Which is a catchy trailer line, sure, but there's no context for it QUITE yet, because they just dive right into that line. Restaurant establishing shot, smash cut to catchy line, and they're in the middle of dinner already. It's a bit sudden.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796560417177600,1531973421
"But I mean, I get why that would be edited. We don't need the entire meal, but at least an introduction to her dinner guests might be nice. Pace yoself. They even seem to be eating quickly.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796561230872576,1531973421
I'm getting the idea that the following scenes will be exposition dumps. Which is... fine. I'll say hesitantly.,ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796562208206848,1531973421
"Oh no, Floyd Lawton's daughter is not a great actress.
Hey, but Batman cameo though! :D",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796563093143552,1531973422
"Wait, Amanda's taking credit for tipping off Batman as to the location and whereabouts of Deadshot? I'm sure he knows, he's BATMAN for god's sake.
I'm getting the idea that in this movie universe, Batman's not hot shit when it comes to information.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796563890073601,1531973422
"""Superfreak."" Because next scene is Margot Robbie's origin tale!
So, for those of you keeping track at home; we're 10 minutes in, we've had 4 songs, and the only characters we've been focused on have been Harley and Deadshot.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796564628262913,1531973422
"Why did we need the beginning intro at all? Why not just start with Amanda Waller eating (metaphorical) Canaries in front of Badges and Stranger Things guy (he was there too, but I couldn't think of a good nickname, so I didn't mention it.)",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019796565437788161,1531973422
"So Harley gets him a machine gun- presumably it comes with a dude in a goat mask, because the next scene after Amanda's ""Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong"" is a furry with a cheap fursuit head getting shot up during what I assume is a break-out.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019801136209920001,1531974512
"...they played a goat's braying sound effect as the goat dude got shot. 
Screw the Makeup and Hairstyling, the sound guy needed an Oscar, just for that.

Oop- there's a dude in a full panda suit that got shot, too. Which is fair- there's no peripheral visibility in those things.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019801137036156928,1531974512
"Ah. The Joker. What can I say about him that hasn't already been said.

He's very Jim Carey, I guess? Which is a fair thing to aim for; I thought Jim'd be a better Joker than he was the Riddler...",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019801138025992192,1531974512
"- but I feel like the tattoos are the wrong direction. I can't imagine the Joker sitting still for hours in a chair for (presumably) multiple visits, by probably not the most reputable of artists. Artists, because I'm sure he murdered at least one.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019801138818715648,1531974513

"Wow, the scene where the Joker, Harley and eyeball-tattoo guy were having their exchange was HEAVILY EDITED. Or Harley's secret super power is that she can sit down really really fast.  Lotsa purples and greens again, when Joker and Harley get mad.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019801140697837569,1531974513
"Love the back of the Jokermobile- but I'd like it MORE if the ""grin"" on the back of the car was a smile, rather than a frowny toothy face like I think it was supposed to be.",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019801141675143168,1531974513
"Captain Boomerang! I have a good feeling about this guy. Also 15 minutes in, and we're still infodumping. This is like Double Down, in that there's more narration than story so far. Also, add another song to the tally. ""Dirty Deeds.""",ThatYawgGuy,,https://twitter.com/ThatYawgGuy/status/1019801142501314560,1531974514

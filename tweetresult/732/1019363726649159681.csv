Yesss ! I watched a video of a girl talking about hers and she said the sides hurt more than the actual kneecap and the next few days she could barely walk,_sallytomato,ohheybail,https://twitter.com/_sallytomato/status/1019366063694376962,1531870783
Ahhhh well i hope she’s lying bc that’s a game changer,ohheybail,_sallytomato,https://twitter.com/ohheybail/status/1019367270135549952,1531871070
Like her knee was a softball after. But she said she loves it and not to let nerves scare you away. And that the tattooing itself wasn’t as painful as she thought it’d be,_sallytomato,ohheybail,https://twitter.com/_sallytomato/status/1019367463316873216,1531871116
Yeahhhh def gonna still get them. It’s all relative to the person bc my mom also said she’d rather go through a natural birth than get another tattoo lol,ohheybail,_sallytomato,https://twitter.com/ohheybail/status/1019367709807702018,1531871175
Lollll that’s insane. Giving birth is hell and I will literally tattoo my eyeball before I do it without the epidural,_sallytomato,ohheybail,https://twitter.com/_sallytomato/status/1019367912791072770,1531871224

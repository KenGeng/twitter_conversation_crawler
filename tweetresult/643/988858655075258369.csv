"Colin,
Thank you for acting in the finest traditions of democracy: Protesting and seeking redress for the wrongs of our government… A great responsibility of all citizens… But one that only a select few will do at the risk of great personal expense and ridicule. You are a hero.",AmazingDouglass,"yourrightscamp,Kaepernick7",https://twitter.com/AmazingDouglass/status/988862578272145408,1524598185

Props to Brother Colin. Has his speech been posted anywhere yet and if so where? I hope one day after the grievance is settled and hopefully won to write a feature on Colin.,Sckribe99Brian,"yourrightscamp,E_Reid35",https://twitter.com/Sckribe99Brian/status/988869709771755521,1524599885

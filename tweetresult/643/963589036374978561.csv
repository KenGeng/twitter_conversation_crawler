"The bigger question is, why the fuck are the military on food stamps?
57% of the budget + non-discretionary goes to military.",HanxFingers,"RealTimBlack,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/HanxFingers/status/963599324788805633,1518574956

"As a miltary spouse for 22 years, the COLA in an area can affect snap benefits for a family. An airman in San Diego and an airman in Oklahoma City, base pay is the same. There’s more factors that need to be considered, it’s not as clear cut as it seems.",luvthmgators,"RealTimBlack,realDonaldTrump",https://twitter.com/luvthmgators/status/963591800022761473,1518573162
"If your getting benefits while in San Diego and PCS to Oklahoma City even though your making the same base pay, those benefits can be cut. SNAP shouldn’t be allowed to be accepted at convince stores either.

"You’d have to understand the make-up of the military. Generally speaking, the enlisted staff come from impoverished inner city or rural areas. Those from the south are typically from (R) households.

I was an Air Force brat and many of the kids who I went to school with in DOD schools were getting free or reduced price lunches. This will make it worse. Its more than 1% I can tell you.

"It still is unfathomable that uninformed people still think that food stamps are used most by African-Americans, 40% are white, 25% African-Americans, 2%Asian, 20%, Hispanic and east Indian.

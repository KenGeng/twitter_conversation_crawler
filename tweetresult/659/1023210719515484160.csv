"#,AMJoy, Gotta love ,@,MalcolmNance, . Of all of the trump scandals the 2016 tower meeting is his favorite. It's the most blatant move by the Russians and the trump team to work together.",Durden112,,https://twitter.com/Durden112/status/1023210719515484160,1532787420
"I would like to add, for pure hypocrisy reasons, the meeting our AG had with Russians but lied about in his confirmation. He was just a lowly senator then so that didn't count. Even though he was also on the campaign. What part of ANY MEETINGS WITH RUSSIANS do you not understand?",ohiovoter55,"Durden112,MalcolmNance",https://twitter.com/ohiovoter55/status/1023220165834690561,1532789672

It was the signal sent by acceptance of the meeting that sets the narrative. It told Putin that the Trump campaign was willing to play ball. Trump knew there would be an ask that they would have to give! The deal was sealed!,wck461,"Durden112,MalcolmNance",https://twitter.com/wck461/status/1023213276061200384,1532788030

What's truly idiotic is that the Russians never intended to provide kompromat in that meeting. It was a meeting to gauge whether the idiot Trumps would take a meeting based on the promise of something illegal.,OhhhBuddha,"Durden112,MalcolmNance",https://twitter.com/OhhhBuddha/status/1023371041593147392,1532825644

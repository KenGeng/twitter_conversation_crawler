Dark irony to Maggie Haberman’s latest puff-piece about Ivanka and Jared is the doubling of nepotism in her own story. Her father has worked for NYTimes for over 4 decades. Her mother did Comms for both the Trumps & Kushners.  Stunning the Times feels no need to make this clear.,KaivanShroff,,https://twitter.com/KaivanShroff/status/1023380808915025920,1532827972

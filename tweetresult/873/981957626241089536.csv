Half the people that are complaining probably work for astroturfing farms. Don’t worry about it Bernie. Twitter is not an accurate representation of how the public at large actually feels,StoneSculptorJN,BernieSanders,https://twitter.com/StoneSculptorJN/status/982023916557361152,1522967721
No lie I have Repub friends who’ve called me to say “tell me again about Bernie”. They might hold their nose but they recognize someone needs to look out for US. Not the donors.

"You, sir need to be embarrassed with the despicable comments you made abt president Obama. No one has twisted your words, those words came out of your own mouth.

"We are very loyal to the party, I'll never understand why ,@,TomPerez, and the ,@,DNC, is allowing Bernie Sanders to hijack a party he doesn't belong to.

"You have every right to speak up and speak out. Bernie is the reason why we're all mad. He think it's okay to attack Hillary and PBO without facing a backlash.

Perhaps it’s because registered Dems (you know the base who actually support the party) dislike you because you sow so much discord and disunity. We don’t like to be lectured by someone who hasn’t achieved much in his political career.,ahsan1,BernieSanders,https://twitter.com/ahsan1/status/981966968763895808,1522954144
gonna need a source on that. the absolute lowest poll i've found still shows that over 70% of Democrats approve of Sanders,shotaconmunism,"ahsan1,BernieSanders",https://twitter.com/shotaconmunism/status/981968666882289669,1522954548

"Yes, he endorses a lot of long-shot candidates who generally don't win their first election. Big whoop. As I've said, his PAC has been successful!

And would you really call Doug Jones a victory when he votes with the GOP more often than Susan Collins does?",shotaconmunism,"ahsan1,BernieSanders",https://twitter.com/shotaconmunism/status/981971426126192641,1522955206
"The point is that Doug Jones only won because the Dem Party was extremely effective in getting out the vote both in AL and VA. And while Jones is not the most ideal candidate he has voted with the Party on some crucial bills.

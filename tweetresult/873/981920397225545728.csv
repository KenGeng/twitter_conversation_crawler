"I've got some thoughts about the recently released original Tupac ""Seven Day Theory"" liner notes. H/T to my brother ,@,JohnGotty, for sending it to me yesterday.,https://,theundefeated.com/whhw/tupac-man,uscript-makaveli/, ,…",JustinTinsley,,https://twitter.com/JustinTinsley/status/981920397225545728,1522943040
"Before you ask, no I'm not surprised at all. But it still sucks to know 'Pac died with that much hatred in his heart. He was a totally different person in 1996. Hardly recognizable in a lot of ways.",JustinTinsley,,https://twitter.com/JustinTinsley/status/981920983853527041,1522943180
"For all the incredible facets about him, the music he made and the energy he gave off while he was alive, it's this hatred and animosity that's just as much part of that, too. Because he was so emotional, he was a pawn in a game that was far bigger than him.",JustinTinsley,,https://twitter.com/JustinTinsley/status/981921323353100289,1522943261
"I'm not saying he didn't have merit to some of the people he lashed out against. Quite a few of those names didn't have his best interests at heart when he was alive. But just the same, he lashed out at others who didn't deserve it. Death Row Pac is tough to grapple.",JustinTinsley,,https://twitter.com/JustinTinsley/status/981921863931744258,1522943390
"He was such an emotional dude—and at times that worked in his favor. But that emotion made him vulnerable to manipulation. It sounds crazy (and admittedly very easy for me to say from a laptop), but getting out of jail may have been the worst thing for 'Pac.",JustinTinsley,,https://twitter.com/JustinTinsley/status/981923282097229825,1522943728
"Pac will always be my favorite rapper. But it's just wild looking back on those years. It just hurts to see the animosity he died with. Again, however merited, it's painful. He had so much more to given than the 25 years he did.,https://,theundefeated.com/whhw/tupac-man,uscript-makaveli/, ,…",JustinTinsley,,https://twitter.com/JustinTinsley/status/981925838416498688,1522944337
"Many saying everyone in the letter ""deserved"" Pac's venom. I'm won't debate that. That's for people who actually lived on the front lines and know details we never will. What I'm saying is my favorite artist of all time dying with so much anger in his soul is heartbreaking. TO ME",JustinTinsley,,https://twitter.com/JustinTinsley/status/981930586603483136,1522945469

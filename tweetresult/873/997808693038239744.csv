Only thing missing from the Royal Wedding was the jumping the broom....shameful and so sad to subject good people to someone’s ego gone amuck.,JcSato21,lkigai_,https://twitter.com/JcSato21/status/998300010163798018,1526848244

They talk about slavery at their weddings? This was a time to ask God to bless the union of two people not to preach at them. This was not your audience.  If you want to preach at people talk to the people in Chicago that are killing black on black.,darwolford,lkigai_,https://twitter.com/darwolford/status/998316370038345728,1526852145

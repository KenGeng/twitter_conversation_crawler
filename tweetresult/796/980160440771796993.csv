"This isn’t nature, but a tiger farm in china, the dark side of animal farms. The drone is to keep these animals fit before slaughter",nautilis7,Thescarynature_,https://twitter.com/nautilis7/status/980172103231070208,1522526214
"That is what I was thinking. I am certain that one suffered pad burns not to mention smoke inhalation injuries for several. The back ground music also made me sick. ,#,AnimalTorture",acornleaf,"nautilis7,Thescarynature_",https://twitter.com/acornleaf/status/980173650211913728,1522526583
Did you really say smoke inhalation injuries? Lol these tigers are alot tougher than we are. A little smoke won't even phase them. Maybe surprise them as they don't understand it but tiger are savages.. inhalation injuries.. ,Gripsession,"acornleaf,nautilis7,Thescarynature_",https://twitter.com/Gripsession/status/980175739218681856,1522527081
I bow to your masculine knowledge and superiority on the subject matter.  Such force and put down language you use here. You must be a a sex God.,acornleaf,"Gripsession,nautilis7,Thescarynature_",https://twitter.com/acornleaf/status/980192667291205632,1522531117
"Ohh look a response that has nothing to with the subject matter in the form of sarcasm, these are premature symptoms of a condition known as ,#,triggered,.",Gripsession,"acornleaf,nautilis7,Thescarynature_",https://twitter.com/Gripsession/status/980228623348113408,1522539690
"Well the onus rests with you for doing the triggering. I am just a girl who calls out ungentlemanly behavior when they spew bull crap. I bow once again to your superiority, sir king of the animal Kingdom. Please believe that. You are the tops!

This is a tiger barn where they breed tigers to be killed for their coats and bones. That’s why there’s so many together and so obese.,otoCarreiS,Thescarynature_,https://twitter.com/otoCarreiS/status/980189144486903808,1522530277

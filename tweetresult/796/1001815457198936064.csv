"Parenting courses !!!! Parents need educating first hand. Let’s show how many cheap, good quality meals can be made from mince, a whole chicken, cneaper cuts like heart and liver. Veggie dishes too.

"Surely cooking, food etc should be part of the weekly curriculum from a much earlier age. More than just cooking scones and pizza but a proper curriculum that will be useful for their rest of their lives. Swimming is seen as an essential life skill?

"Can we start a petition to support the enacting of these?  At the end of the day they are just that, recommendations, and nothing will come of them unless the government chooses to pick them up and legislate.

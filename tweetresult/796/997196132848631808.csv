"I'm not so sure. Look at big animal hunters: even they don't hunt when ""full"" and they store food (not within their bodies) for later eating. I'm not saying the ""global"" environment doesn't matter -- it makes things easier, that's for sure -- but what's changed is more cultural.",NoGimmicksNutri,"MattMatz,CarbSane",https://twitter.com/NoGimmicksNutri/status/997528069979111424,1526664199
"""They don't walk around with low body fat percentages.""

Show me an morbidly obese alligator, cheetah, or tiger.

""neither do humans as we also stop eating when full""

"Are there some animals that purposely gain excess weight? Sure, great example is those who hibernate. But of those who don't hibernate (and even some who semi-hibernate), many eat until full and stop hunting, even going to the extent of storing excess food from a hunt for later.",NoGimmicksNutri,"MattMatz,CarbSane",https://twitter.com/NoGimmicksNutri/status/997976667598544896,1526771153

"From my Dr when diagnosed as ,#,diabetic, - worst advice ever! A low carb diet is essential to improve blood sugar. Bread, potatoes, rice & chapatti must be an occasional TREAT.  Study Ketogenic diet & intermittent fasting on YouTube for insulin control & diabetes reversal ,pic.twitter.com/VzL1g5dDsX",NannyBettyAB,,https://twitter.com/NannyBettyAB/status/1023571058312523777,1532873331
The trouble is that the medics give contradictory advice. In my case depending on the doctor determined the amount of certain drugs I take. My advice is do whatever you feel most confident with and then stick with it. Love you my nanny,BabyAlice030148,NannyBettyAB,https://twitter.com/BabyAlice030148/status/1024048026824990725,1532987050

Ask your doctor to test you & let me know how you get on. I have tested 4 people recently & 2 were sadly diabetic. It is not just obese people either ,NannyBettyAB,tiger_erickson,https://twitter.com/NannyBettyAB/status/1023951618381946880,1532964064

"When Betty told me about this advice, the thing that particularly shocked me was that no distinction was made between, say, white bread and wholemeal bread (the latter being higher in fibre), or white basmati rice and wholegrain rice. (White basmati is V BAD for this!).",DominaMelody,NannyBettyAB,https://twitter.com/DominaMelody/status/1024185472183091200,1533019819

I commented on the other tweet saying carbs should not be avoided. I had no idea it was because of diabetes; That is different; But you do still need carbs.,babyallen332,NannyBettyAB,https://twitter.com/babyallen332/status/1023686966796328960,1532900966

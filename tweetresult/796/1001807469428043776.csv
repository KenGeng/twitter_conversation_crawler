"Tony the Tiger has been around for over 60 years and now all of a sudden he's a problem? obese kids are a result of poor parenting and not unhealthy food, I know loads of people(including me) who eat plenty of junk/sugary food but are still thin, as long as you don't eat much.",JackTheFact29,dunnace,https://twitter.com/JackTheFact29/status/1001812476739162113,1527685681

"Hang on... Those MPs have grown up with all those cartoons on 'unhealthy food'. Are all our generation obese? Were we obese as kids? Utter nonsense - it's not the packaging causing the problem.,https://,twitter.com/BBCNews/status,/1001699764466012160, ,…",faulknerdrew,,https://twitter.com/faulknerdrew/status/1001700625862754304,1527659014
I'm struggling here. How many kids are too fat from overeating fucking corn flakes? If it's more than 5 kids in the entire UK I'd be surprised.,760SJR,faulknerdrew,https://twitter.com/760SJR/status/1001726831802888193,1527665262
"Looked it up - bowl of Frosties with milk is 152 calories. Or about 10% of a daily intake for a kid, 1% for a Bas. It's not the Frosties making them fat, in fact it's probably better if they eat more of them instead.",faulknerdrew,760SJR,https://twitter.com/faulknerdrew/status/1001728215721930752,1527665592
"It's lack of exercise that's the problem. You know how kuch a kid has to eat to become fat? It's ridiculous. Limit time on PlayStation, force to go outside and do a sport = problem solved",760SJR,faulknerdrew,https://twitter.com/760SJR/status/1001729325530574848,1527665857

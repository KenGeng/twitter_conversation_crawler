"Trump doctor Ronny Jackson said of the physical he conducted on POTUS: He is 75 inches tall, weighs 239 lbs, bpm 68, EKG of heart normal. Treadmill test showed above average exercise capacity.",steveholland1,,https://twitter.com/steveholland1/status/953366161995042817,1516135180
"339 I'd believe, 239? Noooooooo.",DejaToo,steveholland1,https://twitter.com/DejaToo/status/953366766918471685,1516135324
Have you ever seen somebody who is 6 foot 3 inches tall and weighs 339 pounds? Or do you just need glasses?,KingDBF,"DejaToo,steveholland1",https://twitter.com/KingDBF/status/953375952498843648,1516137514
The whole report is fake. This admin is pathologically incapable of truth. 239 lbs. Bull crap.,BaileyPittipat,"steveholland1,JenniferJJacobs",https://twitter.com/BaileyPittipat/status/953367273758130176,1516135445

"literally every single part of that statement is 100% bullshit lol. He magically grew 2 inches over the last decade, conveniently weights exactly 1 pound below the ""obese"" cutoff, and has perfect vision despite using ""i didn't have my glasses"" as an excuse for not reading things",JuanChyna,steveholland1,https://twitter.com/JuanChyna/status/953369232452055042,1516135912

"Yep, he reported his height at 6'1 for years, then he bumped it up to 6'3 last year so that his BMI didn't qualify as ""obese"". Obama was also 6'1, and if you look at pictures of them next to each other, Trump actually looks a tad shorter.",JuanChyna,"wobbly_tiger,steveholland1",https://twitter.com/JuanChyna/status/953384410195415040,1516139531

"6’1 240 is considered Obese, to the highest degree, according to BMI. You really believe this dude can run more than 10 seconds, you’re trippin ",justKTSin,"KingDBF,steveholland1",https://twitter.com/justKTSin/status/953385158064918528,1516139709
"No, no - he cannot fool us. There is NO way Trump only put on 3 lbs from last years physical. 
Above average exercise capacity on a treadmill? How is that possible when he rides a golf cart for exercise.",ItZmeKatherine,steveholland1,https://twitter.com/ItZmeKatherine/status/953367228044496896,1516135434

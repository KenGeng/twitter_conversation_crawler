Trump is not the only president that has been in office while shootings have taken place. He is not to blame. Why even bring politics into this? This is the time to show love and care to those who are victims in this tragic event. Spread love not hate.,mbr006,alexseltzer,https://twitter.com/mbr006/status/965448209505177600,1519015764

Also I would want President Trump to spend time and money on those with mental illnesses and not on gun control. The reason why is because mental illnesses are the source of the problem.

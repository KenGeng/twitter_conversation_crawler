"Artist Brian John Spencer says of his controversial Kingsmill/Sinn Féin image: ""The job of an artist is to look at what's happening and point out the hypocrisy & the bluffery."",http://www.,bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northe,rn-ireland-42648471?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_news_ni&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=northern_ireland, ,…",SJAMcBride,,https://twitter.com/SJAMcBride/status/951420938331009024,1515671402
"I thought the job of an artist was to create art, that cartoon is crass, vulgar and lacking any originality in style, but I haven't heard anyone calling for censorship if you like that sort of thing so be it, politicians should reflect on their actions though",AllisonMorris1,SJAMcBride,https://twitter.com/AllisonMorris1/status/951424516344942593,1515672255
I think calling out politicians not to circulate is 2 try & create an environment of censorship & thought control. Doug Beattie said it accurate reflection of his opinion. I'd rather know what his opinion is. Picture - 1000 words not wrong.

"If people want to hang that cartoon on their wall in poster form so be it, point is that we had victims retraumatised with the McElduff situation last week and unionists who were outraged at that committed an equally crass and inappropriate act posting this shite piece of 'art'",AllisonMorris1,"NigelMcKinney,SJAMcBride",https://twitter.com/AllisonMorris1/status/951430492577988608,1515673680
"I can't put myself in the shoes of victims & what retraumatises people. My experience is that's very personal & subjective. The often forgotten impact on all victims is & should be shocking always. Not to shock is to sanitise, hide & deny. Though I agree none of this helping ppl",NigelMcKinney,"AllisonMorris1,SJAMcBride",https://twitter.com/NigelMcKinney/status/951433636582166529,1515674430

"that’s not art, there is nought in that depiction, that can be appreciated primarily for its beauty either as an application of creative skill or imagination.

Primarily the British government want the truth hidden Katy.  They hide under the false premise of national security.  If they told the truth about their actions on this island it would put an entirely new slant on the conflict and eradicate the suposed unionist moral highground,iosephusmaximus,"katyscarletta1,SJAMcBride",https://twitter.com/iosephusmaximus/status/951579032314884102,1515709095

You are right.  It wasn't a war.  More akin to an attempt at ethnic cleansing by the British state and the detscendants of planters.

I believe it was you who cried for the British Army to come in. Also on bloody Sunday there is new evidence that shows the IRA opened fire on bloody Sunday. I know my history of Ulster thank you.

This image is a picture of the words expressed by the families. The gruesome minibus image is reality used countless times.

Personally I think it's a very strong image that reflects how a lot of people feel about the SF agenda. The meaning behind it is very powerful.

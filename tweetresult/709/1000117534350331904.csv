"If the civil society's fragile bonds weren't torn asunder that exist between the neighbors' families by inviting the State a few generations ago people would have noticed what's taking place in their communities; the state's, not the answer it's the problem that retards civility.",Asif_observer,SarJarGar,https://twitter.com/Asif_observer/status/1000122910726471680,1527282857
"Very true, it’s like putting a frog in cold water & turning up the heat gently, now the waters boiling and we have succumbed to this takeover without flinching. I generally don’t give up, but I’m feeling deflated and beaten today. I wonder if the US will take me in as a refugee!",SarJarGar,Asif_observer,https://twitter.com/SarJarGar/status/1000132155694108673,1527285062
"I would welcome you here to Idaho.  Please apply to immigrate we have a lot of Americans with British origins, including my own wife.  Get started, it's a lengthy affair, we could use more conservative and westerners.

"Haha thanks. I was thinking ahead with the refugee label, if I have to flee the government and police for my political views. I think emigrating the US (through the proper channels) is a tempting option at this point.

"I can barely believe where we are now in the U.K. we are being sidelined for a sick ideology and the government aren’t even hiding it anymore. Shocking that so many brits are still in denial.

I am well aware of the details in this case. Your tweet does not change the facts in my original tweet in any way. Tommy was the first to expose the rape gangs a decade ago & the police/government have been trying to silence him ever since.,SarJarGar,"maxwellten12,GosnellRob",https://twitter.com/SarJarGar/status/1000168919817183232,1527293827

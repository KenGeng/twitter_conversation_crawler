"It's fascinating watching yoons embracing ,#,Bexit, now. But they look ridiculous trying to feign concern about the Scottish economy, when Brexit is going to decimate it.",meljomur,,https://twitter.com/meljomur/status/974667266095747073,1521213759
"Had you won in 2014 we’d have been out of EU for two years already. I shudder to think what Scottish society would be like now after all of the false Nationalist promises gave way to unprecedented austerity, massive tax rises and corporate flight.",dj_forrester,meljomur,https://twitter.com/dj_forrester/status/974937726070992896,1521278242

"Is that the assessments that fail to acknowledge the UK is the only member, except Malta, that exports more outwith the EU than within iit?",stellarimbaud,"meldrumc65,meljomur",https://twitter.com/stellarimbaud/status/974931065977569281,1521276654
That would be an illiterate economic argument. Introducing tariffs and physical barriers to trade applied to almost half your exports will lower the trade activity. Estimates vary but you have seen the numbers. None of them good.,meldrumc65,"stellarimbaud,meljomur",https://twitter.com/meldrumc65/status/974977580934877189,1521287744
"In all reports, the negatives have been pounced on by the media, whilst the positives have been ignored. But either way, figures have been confidently asserted when at best, they're purely controversial estimates.",stellarimbaud,"meldrumc65,meljomur",https://twitter.com/stellarimbaud/status/974996984347201536,1521292370

You were all for leaving the EU in 2014. All this is whining & whinging is just shocking hipocracy,j2502ackie,meljomur,https://twitter.com/j2502ackie/status/974691260542935042,1521219480
"Yes, slight issue here is that Scotland leaving the UK would be Brexit on steroids. The equivalent of chopping off your arm to deal with a cut finger.",VniVdiChestnuts,meljomur,https://twitter.com/VniVdiChestnuts/status/974792497649127429,1521243616

"I simply questioned whether you were one of these people who used the terms U.K. and England synonymously? You appeared to suggest that some outside agency was supporting the Scottish economy.

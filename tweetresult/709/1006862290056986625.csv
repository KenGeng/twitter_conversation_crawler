"It is so amazing to see the complete right wing twitter coming out in support of @atulkochhar on the basis of his freedom of expression, precisely the matter where they had issues against ,@,UmarKhalidJNU, & ,@,kanhaiyakumar",DSaumil13,,https://twitter.com/DSaumil13/status/1006862290056986625,1528889651
"Atul said that Islam is the religion of terrorist, which is technically correct, so he is OK!
What Umar & Kanhaiya said was that there were elements in Indian army that was committing war crimes in Kashmir, even though it may be technically correct but they are anti nationals!!",DSaumil13,,https://twitter.com/DSaumil13/status/1006863131149103104,1528889851
"Just go through ,@,swamv39, 's timeline to see some of the past tweets from Atul Kochar. He is RW, Pro Hindutva, Anti Reservation & Anti Refugees! He will be judged on same basis as right wing judges ""Liberals"" & ""Seculars"". No hiding now.",DSaumil13,,https://twitter.com/DSaumil13/status/1006863699758366721,1528889987
"On a personal level i find Atul Kochar a hypocrite, he talks about India but is a British citizen, supports hindutva but makes Beef dishes, has problems with Rohingya refugees but takes part in refugee welcome events in London! Typical double standard NRI.",DSaumil13,,https://twitter.com/DSaumil13/status/1006864011340611584,1528890061
"At least ,@,UmarCheema1, & ,@,kanhaiyakumar, live in India and face the music. Umar had scholarships to study abroad but refused, you may disagree with their ideology but they are not double standard bigots who will sell their souls to earn name & cash abroad!",DSaumil13,,https://twitter.com/DSaumil13/status/1006864376370876416,1528890148

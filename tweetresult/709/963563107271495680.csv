"The better educated people in the UK voted to Remain and anticipated the problems we are facing.  Rather than be convinced by massive liar Boris Johnson, our job now is to explain to those who have fallen for lies, that Brexit will harm them & their children.

"It's well documented that people who attained university education were more likely to have voted remain.

"Though my theory is was also about level of understanding about EU, esp Single Market and political underpinning of it.

Without critical thinking skills developed during education process, accepted EU bashing press at face value, so less likely to look for contradictory evidence",janelang1961,"ninz50,WillBlackWriter",https://twitter.com/janelang1961/status/963934732147929088,1518654923
I thought ghe vote was secret ballot. How do you know the level of education of those who voted yes or no? Arrogance and dictatorship alive and well.,LedPoet,WillBlackWriter,https://twitter.com/LedPoet/status/963588614172135424,1518572402
Ur prejudice is now complete. I suggest u read up on poverty in the EU. 1 in 7 adults. 1 in 4 in vulnerable groups. So where is this wealth? In the hands of the elite. Y does the EU encourage privatisation if it truly believes in equality. 1 reason y the right is rising across EU,lauz664,WillBlackWriter,https://twitter.com/lauz664/status/963696359600738305,1518598091

"I don't agree. 'Better educated'. 'Didn't anticipate problems'. A lot of Brexiteers simply don't want to be hinged to the EU. That's it in a nutshell. Any pain, they happy to take. But believe it's all surmountable. And will be so relatively quickly.",julia_politics,WillBlackWriter,https://twitter.com/julia_politics/status/963668648048119808,1518591484
"Even if isn't surmountable quickly - it doesn't matter. It's a binary issue. And there is no consideration that our Govt/democracy is part of that 'undemocratic' presentation that they feel EU oozes.

For many leavers it's simply not an uneducated position but one of ideology",julia_politics,"julia_politics,WillBlackWriter",https://twitter.com/julia_politics/status/963669750508347393,1518591747

"Nicely put. I voted remain but am sick of people slamming leavers as thick or uneducated. Pretty sure that arrogance helped push the vote the way it went. ‘I have a better job and a degree, I know better than you’.

"The hard core Leavers won't change their minds I don't believe. But significant chunk those who voted Leave for other reasons are the ones that will.

So what is your evidence to show that the Treasury modelling is wrong? How much will the UK lose in GDP outside the SM and CU? Are the Tories prepared for the reputation for sacrificing the economy on the altar of nationalism?,HelenMagi,BrexiteerGB,https://twitter.com/HelenMagi/status/960118107799945216,1517744969

"You are assuming a hard ,#,brexit, with UK making no contribution so being out of all programmes, thus isolating us from our neighbours.

We don't need to be isolated from our neighbours if they are prepared to be reasonable with us. May I say that it's nice to debate with a respectful remainer. Too many throwing accusations. Respect to u,stevesnell59uk,"HelenMagi,BrexiteerGB",https://twitter.com/stevesnell59uk/status/960122633382658048,1517746048
"Yes, it's good to have a rational debate. The thing is, the UK decided to leave so I'm not sure the EU27 owe us anything. They set the terms and will agree what to compromise on, to benefit the union. They might give us some things but mostly it's up to them alone.",HelenMagi,"stevesnell59uk,BrexiteerGB",https://twitter.com/HelenMagi/status/960123246392856576,1517746194
"Well with respect, they owe us for our actions in 1939, owe us a lot more respect than the likes of Juncker is showing us. That aside as a nation we should all respect one another's countries and I do.

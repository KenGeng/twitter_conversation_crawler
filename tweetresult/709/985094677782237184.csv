"Amazing how the British will not invite Trump to their country for a visit, but will follow him on an insane regime change jaunt over an unproven 75 people killed only a total idiot believes any of this, and 75 deaths is not a pretext for this adventurism!,https://,mobile.twitter.com/10DowningStree,t/status/984968945630437376, ,…",Beautyon_,,https://twitter.com/Beautyon_/status/985094677782237184,1523699848
"""That is what our country has always done"" This is not true. Iraq was destroyed on the strenght of a lie, and everyone knows it. Foreign policy mistakes _are possible_ and this is one. Britain is worth more than 75 Syrians, or three Russians. Military action is NOT the answer.",Beautyon_,,https://twitter.com/Beautyon_/status/985096520377696257,1523700287
"If the Syrian people ceased to exist today, what effect would that have on Britain? None whatsoever. When one million were slaughtered in the Tutsi-Hutu genocide, what did that do to Britain? Nothing. War with Russia over 75 people is literally insane; virtue signalling gone mad.",Beautyon_,,https://twitter.com/Beautyon_/status/985097306184830977,1523700474
"We can say this for sure. If Jeremy Corbyn were Prime Minister, he would _never_ order the use of the British military in this way. For all his socialist insanity, he is more sane than the Tory leader when it comes to foreign policy, and that's saying something.",Beautyon_,,https://twitter.com/Beautyon_/status/985097818036727809,1523700596
"We are all part of big media theatre show here.

US & allies warned Russia about the targets, they were pre-evacuated by Russian orders and the Russians did not try to intercept the strikes.

Do you not find that curious?",jronkain,Beautyon_,https://twitter.com/jronkain/status/985097254460674049,1523700462

"The world has gone completely mad, but I believe dishonest money is the root of most of it. Inflated money has destroyed so much of our society, but people don't understand how much it erodes core values of the entire system.

This is Trump appeasing the war hawks. Just like his last ‘attack’ all for the cameras. Unless this is followed by a substantial escalation next week I see this as potentially positive.,eddiejRobo,Beautyon_,https://twitter.com/eddiejRobo/status/985139601651183619,1523710558
"The UK has always blindly followed the USA but I believe the tide is changing when it comes to the ordinary man on the street.

Talking of the man on the street, I think it's more Trump not wanting to come to the UK, he's worried about the inevitable protests.",BitcoinBhoy,Beautyon_,https://twitter.com/BitcoinBhoy/status/985096971915378688,1523700394

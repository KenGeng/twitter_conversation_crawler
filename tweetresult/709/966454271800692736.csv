"1. Angela Merkel is not the EU. She is 1/27th of the EU. 
2. The Brits chose to have a referendum. If I knew that we would choose to leave then the politicians must have as well. 
3. We made the decision. We should own it, take the conseuqences. Or change it.",Britancula,afneil,https://twitter.com/Britancula/status/969522446146695168,1519987138

EU leadership was arrogant in its tone which reinforced the majority of UK voters determination to cut ties with such arrogance.

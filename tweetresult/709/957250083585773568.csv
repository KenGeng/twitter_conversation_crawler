"Britain stepped up earlier than most, and stood alone.  If Britain had done more, things might have been better, but without Britain, things would have been a damn sight worse.

"That’s post 39, though, and a separate issue. The earlier failure, I think, was to concede so much to a regime that was pursuing appalling domestic abuses in the 30’s.

"Maybe the British Government was slow to act. It's easy to judge with hindsight, but less than 20 yrs after the Great War maybe it's not surprising many preferred appeasement to war - but we did welcome many Jewish refugees.

Less hindsight than a shift in mindset I suspect. Not too long ago some thought apartheid an “internal matter”. We’re less likely to see things that way now. Trumps UK visit is a good example - many fully engaged with a more globalised politics.,MLaffan,"HonestDrJohn,Harryslaststand",https://twitter.com/MLaffan/status/957544671701585921,1517131414

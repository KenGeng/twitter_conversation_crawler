"The ""right of return"" is the demand that millions of Palestinians go not just to Palestine, but to Israel as well, creating two de facto Palestinian states and no Jewish one.

I think the right of return is the right of Palestinian refugees to go back to the villages and homes they were kicked out from. Not to be confused with the Israeli “right of return” which gives the right to any person with a Jewish grandparent to live in Israel,OmarNW3,Yair_Rosenberg,https://twitter.com/OmarNW3/status/1011644976147689475,1530029932

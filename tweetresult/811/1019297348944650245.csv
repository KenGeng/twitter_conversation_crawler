Beto is pro 2A.  So am I. So is almost every Texan I know.  Nothing wrong with encouraging responsible gun ownership.  I’ve been shooting since I was out of diapers.

But many don’t. It should be a requirement to take classes before you can carry. I was out of practice a few years ago and went through 2 defensive pistol classes as a refresher.

"Ted Cruz is attacking Beto O'Rourke's mom. We now know why Cruz didn't really care when Donald Trump attacked his father and wife. Cruz plays just as dirty.

"It might be slander if it's not true. did Cruz say anything that wasn't factual about the case?  The stuff Trump said about Cruz's family, to me, seemed a lot more slippery and vicious.",omarg,adamcbest,https://twitter.com/omarg/status/1004461695471890432,1528317304
The part that is slander to me is how he is acting like Beto is complicit in an old tax error his parents made that had nothing to do with him that has since been rectified. He was equally misleading about the Beto/Robert thing. List goes on...,adamcbest,omarg,https://twitter.com/adamcbest/status/1004462920909115392,1528317597

"Ted’s on the wrong side of real issues so he can’t discuss THAT. Kind of like trump.

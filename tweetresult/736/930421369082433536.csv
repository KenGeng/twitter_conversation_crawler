It’s upsetting that Americans r so intent on destroying opposing views & those who say them. Someday the tables will be reversed & the liberal progressive voices could be silenced.

Maybe so but we still need to fight censorship no matter where you stand. Our freedom of speech and press is being eroded at an alarming rate because some can’t let go of an election and move forward civilly to have discussions and exchange information.,LizAntonelli,"Michael_Bell_,JHveem,theblaze",https://twitter.com/LizAntonelli/status/930430753518882816,1510666952

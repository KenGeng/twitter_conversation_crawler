He did that because the guy was dating his daughter. I'd do it too if I had a daughter and some guy was dating her.

You point a gun at every guy who dates your daughter?  I’ll keep my sons away. They were taught how to treat women correctly without the needing the fear of a shotgun to make them act properly.

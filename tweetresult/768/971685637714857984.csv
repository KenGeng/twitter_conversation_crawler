"seriously why ,#,GiveElsaAGirlfriendand, ,#,GiveElsaABoyfriend,  how about a strong feminine role model that doesn't portray woman and week on there own! Why not a ,#,strongindependentElsa, ?",KillerOompaluma,,https://twitter.com/KillerOompaluma/status/971685637714857984,1520502883
"I wish that The Directors just made her stay strong single woman in Frozen 2 in the first place but since the Directors wanna give her a Love interest we just have to hashtags ,#,GiveElsaABoyfriend, to make sure they don't make her a lesbian in the sequel",dttbinh6296,KillerOompaluma,https://twitter.com/dttbinh6296/status/978203316587909135,1522056819
"Um.. no, dont get me wrong id prefer to have a strong independent Elsa, but if she is gonna get a love interest id rather ,#,GiveElsaAGirlfriend, than allow any credence to those bigoted moppets that are making any excuse to disguise the face they hate lesbians.",KillerOompaluma,dttbinh6296,https://twitter.com/KillerOompaluma/status/978268951208701952,1522072467
"But kids are not ready for the thing like ""Lesbian"" yet, teenagers maybe but not kids. I didn't sign in the petitions for myself, I am doing this for my kids when I am married and have a job. I want them to know why their father choose to be a Character Designer for Disney.",dttbinh6296,KillerOompaluma,https://twitter.com/dttbinh6296/status/978478588168040448,1522122449
"No my bigoted friend, kids are fine at learning, and leaning that people can be all sorts is a very important lesson. i get it you hate lesbians, even if you dont admit it. but a gay Disney character would be essential for helping kids get over their parents bigotry.",KillerOompaluma,dttbinh6296,https://twitter.com/KillerOompaluma/status/978531133884456960,1522134977
"I know what you mean. But  Kids love Frozen back then already and mostly wanted a famous female character like Elsa to have a ,#,Male, love interest, it happened last time with her sister Anna. They may have shipped her with Jack Frost but it is an idea for ,#,GiveElsaABoyfriend",dttbinh6296,KillerOompaluma,https://twitter.com/dttbinh6296/status/978553681787236352,1522140353
"ok, just gonna step in here. do you think that kids are going to be influenced by movies and change whether or not they're lgbt or straight? dude, a movie won't change this that easily. please let people have the representation they deserve.",cactus_fishy,"dttbinh6296,KillerOompaluma",https://twitter.com/cactus_fishy/status/981719540496306177,1522895152
"I know what you mean, its just that no one know for sure that will Elsa get a male love interest or not and yet Director Jennifer Lee said that she just like the idea but no one know will she do it or not. If she does it then every kids might be more worry when watching Frozen",dttbinh6296,"cactus_fishy,KillerOompaluma",https://twitter.com/dttbinh6296/status/982052873994289152,1522974625
"why is it a worry? if they make her or any charismatic gay its fine. if parents have problems relating that to theirs kids when they need to be better parents! personally i just liked the idea of a strong independent woman, i hate it when they crow bar in a love interest.",KillerOompaluma,"dttbinh6296,cactus_fishy",https://twitter.com/KillerOompaluma/status/982331602817630208,1523041079

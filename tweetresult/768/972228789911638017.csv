"Why Jordan Peterson thinks ""Frozen"" is propaganda — but ""Sleeping Beauty"" is genius ,http://,j.mp/2tv1mel, ,pic.twitter.com/WsI5gjBhvi",jordanbpeterson,,https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/972228789911638017,1520632381
"In ,#,Frozen,, two empowered women work together to save the kingdom. 

In Sleeping Beauty, a vengeful woman attacks an innocent one, leaving her to be groped by a dude while she’s sleeping.

"She also ran off to a mountain where she made a castle out of ice and then lived there...for like 12 hours? With no social or civic structure whatsoever--no food, companions.

"Frozen, having an active female and passive male characters is propaganda. Sleeping Beauty, being the opposite, isn't. Why? Because its older. And in the olden days they didn't do propaganda they did ""archetypes"".

That's a tiny snapshot of his critique. One theme you could derive from the narrative is that male influence is merely a tyrannical force in hiding. The merit of an old story they stand the test of time and tend to not be cynical social commentary. They're deeper archetypes.,JacobRidge,"chrispyking2,jordanbpeterson",https://twitter.com/JacobRidge/status/972234049342394368,1520633635
In Frozen Christoph provides a counter point to Hans' 'tyrannical male in hiding'. There is balance. Why are evil sisters; queens; step mothers not equally valid targets? Because they are old. They are 'archetypes'. Sounds like an irrelevant distinction to me.,chrispyking2,"JacobRidge,jordanbpeterson",https://twitter.com/chrispyking2/status/972236357656457216,1520634185
That would be the correct attempt at a counter point. Except the counter to the tyrannical male is not a harmless male but a competent one. To the extent he embodies the virtue of competence is mild. I didn't claim Old=Archetypes. Its more like Old+Still Relevant=Archetypal.,JacobRidge,"chrispyking2,jordanbpeterson",https://twitter.com/JacobRidge/status/972238774741688320,1520634761
"Christoph saves Anna's life, is self made, independent and shrewd. Thats not a mild embodiment of competence.

I sadly heard rumors of them making a sequel where Elsa has a female love interest.

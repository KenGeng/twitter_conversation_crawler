Hello Mister Josh Gad There are rumors about Elsa will get a female love interest in Frozen 2. Many people including kids disagreed and want Elsa get a male love interest like other Disney princesses. My question is that will Elsa get a boyfriend in Frozen 2?,dttbinh6296,"joshgad,ChildrensLA",https://twitter.com/dttbinh6296/status/978883343273086976,1522218950

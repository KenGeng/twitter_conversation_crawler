No need for sequel Disney being greedy not a shocker,The_Brodiie,Shablazlfrazr,https://twitter.com/The_Brodiie/status/970682974197829632,1520263830
That can be said about every Toy Story movie if you choose to—or perhaps you are not the target demographic for a Disney princess film. Just a hunch I have ,Shablazlfrazr,The_Brodiie,https://twitter.com/Shablazlfrazr/status/970686641827229698,1520264704
My only fav Disney princess movie is Moana cos im Poly and I didn’t care for toy story 2 or 3 felt like it was forced so you may be right ,The_Brodiie,Shablazlfrazr,https://twitter.com/The_Brodiie/status/970686988406857728,1520264787
"My favorite Disney Princess is Vanellope because I think her character’s motivations, convictions, and development were important to young girls, and I’m SUPER excited that she’s getting a sequel this November—you’re probably just not the target demographic for kids’ movies lol",Shablazlfrazr,The_Brodiie,https://twitter.com/Shablazlfrazr/status/970688602362413056,1520265171
And Moana has the same values she teaches young woman don’t be scared to be independent seek what you want and try new waters,The_Brodiie,Shablazlfrazr,https://twitter.com/The_Brodiie/status/970689317679984640,1520265342
"Totally fair. I like all those movies, too, haha. I mostly like the new wave of kids’ movies because they’ve started to ditch the “true love” central theme. And I loved Moana, too. I thought her being Polynesian was important for representation reasons 1/",Shablazlfrazr,The_Brodiie,https://twitter.com/Shablazlfrazr/status/970691380212154368,1520265834
"Coupled with the themes of self-perseverance and acceptance, she was a strong role-model-type character for young girls everywhere, but particularly for Polynesian girls. They got to see someone on screen that was dark-skinned and wavy haired—like them. 2/",Shablazlfrazr,Shablazlfrazr,https://twitter.com/Shablazlfrazr/status/970691839765266432,1520265943
"And by getting to see a young, self-empowered, Polynesian Disney “princess” portrayed as the central protagonist of a perilous journey, they were made even THAT much prouder of who they were culturally and interpersonally. Which is why... 3/",Shablazlfrazr,Shablazlfrazr,https://twitter.com/Shablazlfrazr/status/970692402787753984,1520266078

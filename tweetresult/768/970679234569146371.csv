"Mini rant incoming. This thread may contain mentions of self harm and suicide. Here's your trigger warning so you know not to read more, 

With all the people yelling ""What about the children"" about the Elsa may has a female love interest in Frozen2 (pt1)",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970679234569146371,1520262938
"If at a young age I knew that being LGBT+ was okay, I wouldn't have tried killing myself for the first time at 12 years old. Nor would I have such deep self hate that I would have started self harming at the age of 13 (pt 2)",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970680017276555265,1520263125
"I was raised in a very sheltered home. I didn't know what being gay or LGBT+ was or meant until I was much older. And what I did know, or what i thought I knew, it was in the negative light. (Pt 3)",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970681507525271552,1520263480
"So whenever I hear, ""What about the children??""  ""What if it confuses them?"" ""Or what if it makes my child gay???"" As a parent is it your job to inform them of things. Don't make them cold hearted and hateful towards those that are different (pt 4)",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970681984707125249,1520263594
"From my experience kids are the most understanding and fine with LGBT+ people I've ever met. I've never had a kid go, ""Ew gay people"" when I was out in public with my exes. It was only the parents that would go, ""We don't like people like that"" (pt 5)",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970683492253274113,1520263953
"People say that kind of look is gone, and that everyone is okay with us LGBT+ people. I'd beg otherwise. I was raised in a Christian home, not all Christians that I met hated us, some in fact supported us, but not my ""family""",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970683951688900610,1520264063
"They hated people that were pretty much different. I was raised to be homophobic, transphobic, racist, and to be the cliche white girl. But now look at me. 20 years old, gay af, and am in a relationship with my half black and half white fiance.",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970684388550856704,1520264167
"I grew up to be the exact opposite of how I was raised. I didn't let hatred fill my heart, and I knew that how I was raised was wrong. No one should be told to hate someone, simply cuz they're born differently",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970684673881006080,1520264235
"If I could go back in time and tell my younger self, ""You're gonna grow up, and you're gonna make it to 20 years old. You'll be in a wonderful relationship, after much pain and heartbreak. But this relationship? It'll make those 18 years of your life worth it""",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970685101007949825,1520264337
"So, stop with the ""What about the children??"" and start looking at yourself. The only problem I have with Elsa having a love interest, is that she's supposed to be independent, but honestly? If she does have a female love interest, awesome. Btw, I hate Frozen sooo ",Jordie_Bay,,https://twitter.com/Jordie_Bay/status/970685510317420548,1520264434

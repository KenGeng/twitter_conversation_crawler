Reading some comments on here is disgusting. It's a great thing that sth huge like Disney thinks about including LGBT+ in their movies & it also is a huge step in the right direction. I want to live in a world where it's normal & every1 can love who they want w/o being judged. +,DreamySwiftie7,billboard,https://twitter.com/DreamySwiftie7/status/969423807172829184,1519963621
"And it sure as hell won't ""confuse"" kids. It should be normal for them to see women kiss women and men kiss men just like it is for them to see a woman kiss a man.

"And I don't see why she can't fall in love with a woman instead of a man. Maybe she doesn't need a man, but a woman that supports her and who she can trust and love.

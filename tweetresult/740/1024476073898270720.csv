"I gave a lot more than that & if it turns out that Tad Devine / ,@,BernieSanders, conspired with Russia to any degree at all, they should get the electric chair.

Sanders is by association of Devine/Manafort and by his NRA/Russia donation to his campaign guilty. It's possible even likely Sanders-was never involved w a primary in 30 yrs-suddenly jumped in to challenge Dems pick HRC-carried on trashing HRC campaign throughout-creating chaos,56jaytee,tomwatson,https://twitter.com/56jaytee/status/1025039281293877248,1533223383

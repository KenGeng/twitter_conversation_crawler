"Dear Draymond Green (,@,Money23Green,),

You got played.

Flashing a toothy grin w/ a sniper rifle in Israel on a trip sponsored by Friends of the IDF is so horribly offensive.

They've recently slaughtered 100s of unarmed Palestinians w/ those rifles.,https://www.,thenation.com/article/draymo,nd-greens-friends-idf-sponsored-trip-israel/, ,…",ShaunKing,,https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/1016913297340272640,1531285998

"Nope. It continued being an empire because the imperial mentality was never dealt with. The Bolsheviks just decided they couldn't possibly be imperialists because they were supposedly Marxists.

Exactly. One of the first things the Bolsheviks did once in power was to crush other left wing uprisings in places like Poland and Ukraine as they did not respect the self-determination of peoples from the Russian Empire...,SomersetBaller,"RussiawithoutBS,Comrade_ToteBag",https://twitter.com/SomersetBaller/status/1014521599561695232,1530715772

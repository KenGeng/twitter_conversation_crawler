"There is a lot to unpack here.  The US isn’t necessarily a good reflection of the human race. Most immigration policies are not as a result of learning but of the latest boogeyman the racists are blaming for the state of affairs.,https://,twitter.com/batman64batman,/status/1014875449833480192, ,…",mareserinitatis,,https://twitter.com/mareserinitatis/status/1014901424063504389,1530806330
"Racism has always been a factor in our country’s immigration policies. From Italians to Irish to Latin Americans to Muslims, you name a group of people, and you can bet they’ve met with discrimination at one point or another.",slimjimtx,mareserinitatis,https://twitter.com/slimjimtx/status/1014904206963150848,1530806993
Don’t those laws coincide with current high levels of crime? I understand that around the 1920s there was high crime in Italian and Irish heavy areas that slowly leveled off. Isn’t the point of laws for people acting up in society?,GraysonDockery,"slimjimtx,mareserinitatis",https://twitter.com/GraysonDockery/status/1014910409948659718,1530808472
"Still racism.  The eugenicists were arguing that Italians weren't even white.  However, non-Italians were making the same arguments that people make today against Mexicans are responsible for more crime when research shows immigrants commit crime at lower rates than US citizens.",mareserinitatis,"GraysonDockery,slimjimtx",https://twitter.com/mareserinitatis/status/1014914993140232192,1530809565
What studies? Off the top of my head Hispanics make up about 30% of crime where’s blacks at around 50% and whites about 20% at least from the crime reports I’ve seen. If you can send me the ones you are siting I’d love to take a look.,GraysonDockery,"mareserinitatis,slimjimtx",https://twitter.com/GraysonDockery/status/1014915820827312128,1530809762

If we want to talk about the incarnation of blacks in America we need to look at the disparity in crime and see the factors that make people that way in the first place.,GraysonDockery,"mareserinitatis,slimjimtx",https://twitter.com/GraysonDockery/status/1014921072653856768,1530811014
I think fatherlessness is a big factor when talking about crime because it has a high correlation between the two and single motherhood in the black community is about 70% and 30% in the white community.,GraysonDockery,"GraysonDockery,mareserinitatis,slimjimtx",https://twitter.com/GraysonDockery/status/1014921442214006784,1530811102

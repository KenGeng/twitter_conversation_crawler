"Tucker Carlson revealed a vast Mexican espionage operation on his show tonight, bigger than Russia. He didn't explain the details, only that Mexico is packing our electorate, but it's pretty easy to fill in the blanks.

"Imagine you're Mexico. You want to promote Mexican interests in the U.S... from the inside. What do you do? First, you must stage a ""crisis,"" a reason for people to emigrate.

Let's call this ""crisis"" the drug trade.

"The ""drug trade"" is a good front for Mexico because it can involve multiple characters to muddy the waters, like more than one drug cartel, competing gangs, and other countries like ""Colombia"" and ""Venezuela."" It makes it difficult to pinpoint a single bad guy, no?

"After several decades of this ""drug trade,"" Mexican sleeper cell agents disguised as ""regular people"" are all set and ready to ""flee violence."" They can flood the border, requesting ""refugee status"" by the thousands.

"It may take months, even years, but those Mexicans can eventually apply to be U.S. citizens. This is where the conspiracy really heats up. Wait for it...

"Most will never achieve it, but some of these Mexicans will eventually become American citizens after 3, 4, 5, 10-15+ years. It's at this point that they'll be given the right to vote, as if they were regular Americans. Ha!

"Meanwhile, Mexicans will continue to immigrate to the U.S. *illegally*. Those Mexicans will act as the point of contact between the new U.S. citizens and the Mexican government. They will be known as ""friends and family,"" which makes a good cover if they're apprehended.

"Mexico will send its voting directives to the illegal immigrants using encrypted messaging apps. The illegal immigrants will pass the orders onto new ""Americans"" at places like ""work"" or ""the dinner table."" The Mexican government calls this ""political discussions.""

"In the final stage of the operation, supposedly legitimate votes are then cast in U.S. elections by new ""Americans""-- but by MEXICO actually. They'll vote like Mexico wants them to vote, ya follow?

"Mark my words, if this espionage operation (worse than Russia) continues unabated, we could have a ""Mexican-American President"" by 2036.

No, I'm not kidding. THINK about it.

"Thank you for uncovering this spy operation with your journalism, Tucker Carlson. Some say you're racist or covering for Trump and Russia, but let's be honest: those people are probably Mexican.

"Excuse me?! There’s absolutely no excuse for a lack of basic care.,https://,twitter.com/judywoodruff/s,tatus/1014998271532597248, ,…",SouthernKeeks,,https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/1015205961487745024,1530878937
I agree but I need more info. Hadn't been bathed in how long? Toddlers get messy in just a few hours. Also lice prefer clean hair & are hard to get rid of in group settings. My kid goes to a school with many affluent kids. We get messages 3-4x/yr that someone in the class has it,stephaniemedira,SouthernKeeks,https://twitter.com/stephaniemedira/status/1015207566434099205,1530879320
"Why can’t you just say, “Gee, that kid should have been bathed.” Is it so difficult?",SouthernKeeks,stephaniemedira,https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/1015208504993427456,1530879543
Because I'm skeptical of media and anecdotal stories honestly. I agree that kids should be afforded the best care we can give. I'm not ready to go full outrage until I know more like the story of the crying toddler from a few weeks ago that we later found out was never separated.,stephaniemedira,SouthernKeeks,https://twitter.com/stephaniemedira/status/1015209205027033090,1530879710
Didn’t know “there’s no excuse for lack of basic care” was such a stretch. ,SouthernKeeks,stephaniemedira,https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/1015209833631567872,1530879860
Because we don't KNOW there was a lack of basic care. I agreed with you that there is no excuse for not doing it. My point was that we don't know if there WAS a lack of care. When I pick up my toddler from the sitter she's dirty. They played in the yard all day and she's happy.,stephaniemedira,SouthernKeeks,https://twitter.com/stephaniemedira/status/1015214940196671488,1530881078
"not quite as extreme, but if you are following the story about Yeni, the woman being reunited with her three children, one of the things she mentioned was brushing her daughter’s hair over and over, because for the two months they were separated no one ever did it :(",robinmarty,SouthernKeeks,https://twitter.com/robinmarty/status/1015206353713819649,1530879031

"I'm with ,@,RealDanLee, on this one.

Terrible story if true, but all these other terrible stories at the border have had details emerge that have proven them false.

The reporting is so partisan in this area that I’m not sure we can trust any story coming out of the mainstream press. A problem of their own creation.,RealDanLee,SouthernKeeks,https://twitter.com/RealDanLee/status/1015207435915661312,1530879289

Strange to me that this is what's inexcusable not the dehumanizing and irresponsible policy that separated young children from their parents causing untold trauma for all involved and violating any belief in the sanctity of family or parental bonds.,dshapMENTOR,SouthernKeeks,https://twitter.com/dshapMENTOR/status/1015210805606875136,1530880092

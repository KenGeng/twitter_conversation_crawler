"Well, let's just put it this way: imagine I forced my way, with hard power, into your living room, then kicked you out the house, and got upset at you for sleeping in the garden and decried you a tresspasser when I caught you using the bathroom. That's a more fitting analogy.,https://,twitter.com/Allen_TSS/stat,us/1021226051848949760, ,…",WhyKhalfan,,https://twitter.com/WhyKhalfan/status/1021238365822234624,1532317174
"but seriously, if we take our boarder down, should Mexico and Canada take their boarder down? Should Mexico take down it's boarder between Guatemala and Belize as well? Shall we all just live in one world? If so, expect an awful lot of death and economic collapse",Allen_TSS,WhyKhalfan,https://twitter.com/Allen_TSS/status/1021240680713138176,1532317726
"Well, Guatemala and Belize aren't in NAFTA. And they do not share a border with the US so that's a question for them to answer. As for Mexico, the Mexican border has always been open to Americans, just go visit Tijuana from SD. America sadly refuses to reciprocate the gesture.",WhyKhalfan,Allen_TSS,https://twitter.com/WhyKhalfan/status/1021241465731629057,1532317913
"I'm all for making it easy to for any immigrants to come here from any country, not just Mexico, but to get rid out our boarders and boarder enforcement is a horrible and truly ignorant idea.",Allen_TSS,WhyKhalfan,https://twitter.com/Allen_TSS/status/1021242169720369152,1532318081
"Outside of it costing a few thousand jobs, probably the hardest part of abolishment, it's a truly wonderful and progressive idea. Free movement of people is not only a human right, it's an essential feature of our evolution.",WhyKhalfan,Allen_TSS,https://twitter.com/WhyKhalfan/status/1021244063184433152,1532318533
If you like tribal violence and war yeah free movement is great.  I like peace myself so I'm not a big fan of open boarders.,Allen_TSS,WhyKhalfan,https://twitter.com/Allen_TSS/status/1021244535697887234,1532318645
There's a case study for this. Free movement of people in Europe stopped tribal violence. It didn't enhance it. I think y'all forget that the overriding majority of people just want to live in dignity and peace. This tribal violence bullshit is already happening: the drug war.,WhyKhalfan,Allen_TSS,https://twitter.com/WhyKhalfan/status/1021246280461299713,1532319061

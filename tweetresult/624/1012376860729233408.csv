Trump was propped up by the DNC.  His win is on your hands.  Sarandon has helped get people off death row and continues to do good in spite of corporatist Dems who can't get out of their own way.

If you ask anyone who voted 3rd party or didn't vote why they voted (or not) the way they did. Not a single one will say they did so because of Susan Sarandon. Not one.

I remember people shouting “9/11 was an inside job!” and thinking how unpatriotic and disrespectful that was. Thought anyone that doubted the moon landing wasn’t informed and I refused to believe in chemtrails even though the sky changed through my life.

Chemtrails are most certainly real. The trails left by normal planes don’t spread out and become clouds... they dissipate.,ChuckySeagal,"wordbird67,cyclopticalone",https://twitter.com/ChuckySeagal/status/950949820730093568,1515559079
"Those chem trials are specifically targeting you. I'm not sure what you did to get them pissed at you but you better be careful! Best to start putting a big plastic bag over your house.

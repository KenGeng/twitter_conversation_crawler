"BREAKING:

Someone decided Carmen Best will be Seattle Police Chief.

No, it wasn't ,@,MayorJenny,. She didn't want her. 

So, who decided? 

The cops wanted Best.

"lemme get this straight. Jelly snubs Best, then the media starts decrying the snub so Jelly does an about face n selects her?

"You agree with people in the media who already share the same views as you and slam people who think differently as not doing the same based on assumption.

"I’m not upset. Durkan snubbed Best who was supported by the cops till media intervened. See, cops generally know who they want as leader.

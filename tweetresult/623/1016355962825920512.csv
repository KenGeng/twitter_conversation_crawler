In fairness they only changed the headline because the second headline is WAY more likely to do well on social media.,Cianmm,"__kbaker__,dublincycling",https://twitter.com/Cianmm/status/1016361346064113670,1531154402
"The old article is still there, the second article is a video-only piece that just has a headline and a byline. They're potentially the work of two different editors, but I'd be surprised if the online backlash didn't somehow influence the change in approach to the story.",dublincycling,"Cianmm,__kbaker__",https://twitter.com/dublincycling/status/1016361950022946818,1531154546

"The author of that piece, ,@,conor_feehan,, covered the story of a child killed by a driver & called it an ""accident"" before the investigation even started:,https://www.,independent.ie/irish-news/sep,arate-road-accidents-claim-lives-of-teen-cyclist-and-talented-darts-player-37094333.html, ,…",JonBow13,"Dublin_Suzy,dublincycling",https://twitter.com/JonBow13/status/1016362617781346304,1531154705
"What else would I call it before it was investigated? Standard protocol. Do you know if the driver or cyclist was at fault?? If it comes out as anything other than an accident at the inquest stage, or if a garda investigation finds fault we will certainly report that.",conor_feehan,"JonBow13,Dublin_Suzy",https://twitter.com/conor_feehan/status/1016406540599820290,1531165177
"Generally speaking, the word ""collision"" has replaced ""accident"" in official circles in recent years",Dublin_Suzy,"conor_feehan,JonBow13",https://twitter.com/Dublin_Suzy/status/1016407652681900032,1531165442
"Yes collision or crash are suitable neutral terms. 
The issue people have with ""accident"" is that it can imply an absence of blame or fault, and in a situation where someone has been seriously injured or suffered a violent death, that shouldn't be the default position.",dublincycling,"Dublin_Suzy,conor_feehan",https://twitter.com/dublincycling/status/1016441310549626880,1531173467

"@,JohnBerman, I'm not understanding why there is so much outrage for children being separated from their parents for committing crimes when it happens every single day in America that is the law if you commit a crime and you have your child with you your child is removed from you",gobucs9955gmai1,,https://twitter.com/gobucs9955gmai1/status/1009413385191067648,1529497879
Just wondering how if somebody commits a crime or shoots up heroin with their kids in a car & a cop catches them should we arrest the parent & the child and put them both in jail together or should we separate the child from the parent because the parent put that child in danger,gobucs9955gmai1,,https://twitter.com/gobucs9955gmai1/status/1009413874255310848,1529497996
Not only did the illegal immigrants put their child in great danger by making the trip in the first place they put them in danger by Crossing illegally instead of going to a legal Port of Entry the kids should be separated from their mother the mother endangered that child,gobucs9955gmai1,,https://twitter.com/gobucs9955gmai1/status/1009414148432781313,1529498061

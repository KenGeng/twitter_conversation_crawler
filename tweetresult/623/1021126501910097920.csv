"My mother did forget me. I was 3 months old, not sleeping, so neither was she. 

I am here because it was a cloudy, cool, rainy April. And because 70s cars had wing windows that were easy to force, so the door could be opened.

"I’m more than tired of the “though I dropped him off” bulls**t.If theyknow if they drop their child off, they shouldn’t be parents.

I get that life becomes a whirlwind of activity when you have an infant. There is no excuse to not ALWAYS check the back seat to see if your child is there.,syrnian,"RedTRaccoon,pandaluver365",https://twitter.com/syrnian/status/1021364162390261760,1532347166
"It’s amazing that anyone can still put forth the argument that they forgot they had a child in the back seat.

Bullshit!!  The fact that she came out asking if the child was okay.  She left that child in the car to run into the store. I do not believe her.  I bet this was not her first time she has done it but the first time she got caught.

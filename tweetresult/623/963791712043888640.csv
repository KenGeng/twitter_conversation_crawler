"Last night at a stop light. Adjacent light turns green. Hear this a loud grinding sound. Expect to see a shitty car with a bad muffler. Instead itâ€™s a newish Fiat with no front tire, and sparks kicking up farther and farther as he accelerated. It looked so fucking rad.,pic.twitter.com/XZ2RSv6kaU",AndyTheBlanch,,https://twitter.com/AndyTheBlanch/status/963791712043888640,1518620825
Saw someone in Yarmouth once driving with no back tires. Turns out they crashed down the road and were high on heroin with their child in the back of the car.....oops.,DavidSTurn,AndyTheBlanch,https://twitter.com/DavidSTurn/status/963807987264557057,1518624705

lol sounds awesome. Though I'm sure that Fiat owner's brain will explode when they see the repair cost for that.,kagemusha23,AndyTheBlanch,https://twitter.com/kagemusha23/status/963792402010918914,1518620989

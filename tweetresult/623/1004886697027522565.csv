"Can we talk about what it means that the feds are separating minor children from parents at the border? Because I know we recognize, instinctively, that it's cruel, but it's worth noting the safeguards that are usually in play when the state takes kids from parents.

"2. (I'm a public defender and all I do is represent children and parents in child protection matters. The law of neglect, a use, and family separation is my bread and butter so let me tell you how it works.)",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886698759802882,1528418633
"3. Under US law, there is a *constitutional right* to family integrity. That means that parents' right to raise their kids - and kids' right to be raised by their parents - is recognized as a fundamental liberty interest.",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886700991111168,1528418634
"4. As a practical matter, that means that courts make presumptions *against* family separation. To remove kids, even in an emergency, the state has to show an IMMEDIATE risk of SERIOUS physical harm.",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886702996033537,1528418634
"5. In most states, once the risk is not immediate, the parent can go back to court and, even if they can't get CPS wholly out of their life, they can seek to get their kids home.",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886704745050115,1528418634
"6. Research and experience has taught us that family separation is so traumatic and damaging to kids, and the right to family integrity is so fundamental, that the standard for keeping kids with parents is that the parents be ""minimally adequate.""",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886706309554177,1528418635
"7. In other words, between a perfect, wealthy foster home and an impoverished bu not dangerous biological parent, the parent wins. Between a great grandparent and a minimally adequate parent, THE PARENT STILL WINS.",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886708012441600,1528418635
"8. When the state does remove children, in almost every case, it has an obligation to make reasonable efforts to rehabilitate the parent and reunify the family. Usually, these efforts continue for about two years.",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886710428282881,1528418636
"9. I'm not saying the child protection system is perfect or just, but it is predicated on an understanding that YOU ONLY SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM PARENTS IN CASES OF REAL PARENTAL SHORTCOMINGS, AND THEN YOU TRY HARD TO REUNIFY.",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886712131244032,1528418636
10. I've seen parents with serious heroin problems reunified with their kids; a father who broke his child's leg by throwing the child down in anger; a mother who ran someone over on purpose with her kids in the car.,RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886714140319745,1528418637
"11. So when the feds act like family separation is a logical and just consequence of a parent committing a misdemeanor, or when they act like being in foster care is no big deal, they are operating well beyond what any state court would allow.",RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886715310530560,1528418637
12. They're also acting counter to the widely accepted understanding of what is best for children. It's inhumane and it's unconstitutional.,RSGAT,,https://twitter.com/RSGAT/status/1004886717147566080,1528418637

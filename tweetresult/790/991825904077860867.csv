"You have to much time on your hands and to much hatred in your soul. You should consider cutting back on the liberal kool-aid. 
P.S Trump now got north Korea to release 3 U.S prisoners. 
How you like them apples :-)",Norm19777,Abbott_Anne_,https://twitter.com/Norm19777/status/991826896538292224,1525304934
"My soul is good but thanks for worrying about me.  I am thrilled by them apples.  The idea of Americans imprisoned anywhere is horrific-for the prisoners.  It's about them, not him.",Abbott_Anne_,Norm19777,https://twitter.com/Abbott_Anne_/status/992076324482187265,1525364402
"He also lowered my taxes and made it so I don't get fined for not being able to afford health insurance. 
My father and grandfather are getting better treatment at the VA. 
I beg you to please try to see the good he is trying to do. The 93 percent liberal controlled media won't.",Norm19777,Abbott_Anne_,https://twitter.com/Norm19777/status/992126020638650368,1525376250
"My taxes are lower too-that's not the point. We live in a society, so I don't judge everything on if I personally gain by it.  I want an educated populace-because it's good for society.  I live in an area with higher taxes-because I like paved roads and libraries.",Abbott_Anne_,Norm19777,https://twitter.com/Abbott_Anne_/status/992127118208307200,1525376512
"I don't mind paying a bit more so that more people can have a chance.  I live in an area surrounded by farms, and many of my friends who are farmers and who voted for him are about to get hit horrifically by the backlash on the tariffs.",Abbott_Anne_,"Abbott_Anne_,Norm19777",https://twitter.com/Abbott_Anne_/status/992127371523317760,1525376572
I'm glad the penalty for not having insurance went away but I always understood the rationale for having it.  Just like we're required to have car insurance-someone's lack of healthcare options mean using ERs for primary care and raising rates for everyone.,Abbott_Anne_,"Abbott_Anne_,Norm19777",https://twitter.com/Abbott_Anne_/status/992128150388736000,1525376758
"I don't know how much of the ""liberal mainstream media"" you watch but one thing I see is those reporters saying, ""we reached out the WH for comment"" &""to present the other side of the story...""  I never see that on Fox-not even when they were pretending to be fair and balanced.",Abbott_Anne_,"Abbott_Anne_,Norm19777",https://twitter.com/Abbott_Anne_/status/992128684835385345,1525376885
Obama care didn't work for those of us that are hovering just above poverty though. I made to much to qualify for assistance but not enough to afford it. I believe that the tariffs will be fine. He's is negotiating and I have faith that he will do good. I too have family and,Norm19777,Abbott_Anne_,https://twitter.com/Norm19777/status/992130066833461249,1525377215

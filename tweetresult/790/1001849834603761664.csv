"@,acasorguk, how does religion and belief guidance work when two different faiths or beliefs clash? You have a right to your belief which may be marriage is between a man & women or there are only two biological genders. How do you satisfy both sides equally without discriminating?",tempo_slow,,https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001849834603761664,1527694588
"And why should an employer bend over backwards and change say uniform policy for a minority instead of the potential employee accepting that a uniform is part of the job. If you don't like it, maybe that isn't the job for you.",tempo_slow,,https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001850610734559232,1527694773
"Also how do you avoid discriminating against those who are agnostic or atheist when it comes to work practice or leave? If someone downs tools at a specific time to prey, does everyone else get a break at that time?",tempo_slow,,https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001851241679540225,1527694924
I've always found that when you attempt to legislate for equality you never actually get it because someone will always end up losing out or being discriminated against. It is good for virtue signalling though.,tempo_slow,,https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001851594105937920,1527695008
The UK has long been a welcoming place and has made allowances for faith etc in the workplace prior to legislation.Sometimes unpleasant people need to be revealed for who they are and the absence of a law permits that.,t_arab,"tempo_slow,acasorguk",https://twitter.com/t_arab/status/1001872246347091968,1527699932
"The law doesn't prevent discrimination, it exchanges one form for another. When it's a clash between different beliefs be it faith, political or opinion, someone always ends up losing thus they are discriminated against.",tempo_slow,"t_arab,acasorguk",https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001933233053892610,1527714472
Look at that bakery that refused to make a cake for a gay couple. Under the law they've freedom of religious belief & in their faith marriage is between a man / woman. The gay couple sued for discrimination & won. In winning the religious couples beliefs were discrimated against.,tempo_slow,"tempo_slow,t_arab,acasorguk",https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001934140973944832,1527714688
Had they gone to an Islamic bakery they'd have likely been met with the same refusal. It's like people who say they are intolerant of intolerance. It's an oxymoron.,tempo_slow,"tempo_slow,t_arab,acasorguk",https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001934599369437184,1527714798
You can believe what you want without forcing those beliefs on others.,omeagoz,"tempo_slow,acasorguk",https://twitter.com/omeagoz/status/1001938247193432064,1527715667
"And what exactly do you think legislation does? It legally forces those with freedom of religion or an alternate belief to comply with something against their beliefs. I guess it's ok, if you're on the winning side.",tempo_slow,"omeagoz,acasorguk",https://twitter.com/tempo_slow/status/1001940048349102086,1527716097

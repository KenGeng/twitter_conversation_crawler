"The world doesn’t quite know what the Indian state is up to. After Dalits & Muslims, with the help of Rwanda Radio equivalents in ,@,TimesNow, & ,@,republic,, it is going after the Christian minorities now. यह पाप का घड़ा भरेगा.",BabaGlocal,,https://twitter.com/BabaGlocal/status/998783862510567425,1526963603
"Apparently, not anytime soon! 40% Christians voted for BJP in the recently concluded Karnataka polls.,http://www.,thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/,how-the-numbers-stack-up/article23906252.ece, ,…",Just_Jharna,BabaGlocal,https://twitter.com/Just_Jharna/status/998785822773178368,1526964071
"Similar reports about Muslims voting for BJP in UP came out. Turned out to be false. Plus why is everyone being obsessed with the Christian vote? They are such a tiny part. It's Hindus and only Hindus only will win you elections.

"Exactly. As ,@,kevsolmn, pointed out. This is an exit poll done by ABP (as if one could trust exit polls).

Even if you go by figures. Isn't 40% too high a figure? 

Of you get such massive support then how come your party's vote share fell below INC's?",SuzaneN_,"HilalVivaan,Just_Jharna,BabaGlocal",https://twitter.com/SuzaneN_/status/998803302660751360,1526968238

"No Christian would touch BJP in such a state , with a bargepole.

And even if you believe that report to be true, how come 40% massive votes from one community couldn't get BJP ahead of INC wrt voteshare? 

That is almost equal to having entire community's vote bank.",SuzaneN_,"HilalVivaan,Just_Jharna",https://twitter.com/SuzaneN_/status/998809915098464257,1526969815

"Eugenics has always been a difficult idea for me to comprehend. On the surface, the intention is actually pretty solid. Then I get reminded of 2 Samuel 6. The ark of God is being transported to the City of David. At Nakon, the oxen stumbles, it seems the ark will topple over...",___Teach,"___Teach,al_Bert_",https://twitter.com/___Teach/status/989803103963803648,1524822424

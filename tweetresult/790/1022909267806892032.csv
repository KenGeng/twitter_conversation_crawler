"We published the beloved and behated book, Lords of Chaos. We have seen the film. It explores the relationships between the band members but omits the occult explorations. We still say go see it.",feralhouse,BDisgusting,https://twitter.com/feralhouse/status/1023254185213652992,1532797783
It’s about Black Metal not Death Metal.,NJT75Owl,BDisgusting,https://twitter.com/NJT75Owl/status/1022917155036254209,1532717429
"Gotta be an ass and point out that this is about black metal, not death metal, and none of the people portrayed in the movie want anything to do with it. Skip this and watch ""Until the Light Takes Us"" instead.",PixelElixir,BDisgusting,https://twitter.com/PixelElixir/status/1022919288892661761,1532717938

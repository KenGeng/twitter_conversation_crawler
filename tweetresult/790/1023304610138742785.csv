"MB thugs were armed & ready to kill, why are you trying to make it seem like those fanatics & thugs are the victims of an evil crackdown by Egyptian security forces on peaceful protestors, they were NEVER peaceful, it wasn't a massacre it was a fight between police & terrorists.,pic.twitter.com/ikJ6CZfa7n",The_Dragon_King,"ddknyt,Byoussef,nytimes",https://twitter.com/The_Dragon_King/status/1023490428648218625,1532854108

I read your piece last night & have been mad ever since. John Kerry & James Mattis's ignorance/bigotry cost Egyptians any hope of progress. Morsi never had a chance.

"Clearly you did ZERO research on the Egyptian side of issue or only listened to Muslim Brotherhood thugs who lie all the time (i.e Taqyia), they turned one of Cairo's most prestigious streets and surrounding area into a warzone, ending that cost security forces 40 officers lives.,pic.twitter.com/Xt6dGpd9kA",The_Dragon_King,"ddknyt,Byoussef,nytimes",https://twitter.com/The_Dragon_King/status/1023489231711289344,1532853823
"Muslim Brotherhood terrorists & thugs also made an explicit threat citing that violent ISIS-backed terrorism in S.Sinai is response to Morsi's removal, and that it will stop moment he is a president again, where is your integrity!?,https://www.,egypttoday.com/Article/2/1720,6/Did-Beltagy-keep-his-word-amid-repetitive-terrorist-attacks, ,…",The_Dragon_King,"ddknyt,Byoussef,nytimes",https://twitter.com/The_Dragon_King/status/1023488249887637504,1532853588
"Muslim Brotherhood thugs killed & terrorized hundreds of Egyptians all across Egypt, made threats to burn Egy Christians & carried them out (burned more than 40 churches across Egypt in the span of few days), threw Egyptian protestors off roofs like ISIS, why no mention of that!?,pic.twitter.com/vxfUChlV8Y",The_Dragon_King,"ddknyt,Byoussef,nytimes",https://twitter.com/The_Dragon_King/status/1023487065609187328,1532853306
"More importantly you make a lie by omission when you mention the security forces ""crackdown"" on Muslim Brotherhood and intentionally don't mention what that crackdown was in reaction to (a wave of violence, terrorism unleashed by MB thugs in reaction to removing their president),pic.twitter.com/0un59pgyCH",The_Dragon_King,"ddknyt,Byoussef,nytimes",https://twitter.com/The_Dragon_King/status/1023485707812327424,1532852982
"David, it wasn't a coup man, wtf!?, when millions take to the streets and demand their militaty take action (again like in 2011 when they ousted Mubarak) aganist an increasingly theocratic fascistic president and gov like that of the Muslim Brotherhood then it's a revolution.",The_Dragon_King,"ddknyt,Byoussef,nytimes",https://twitter.com/The_Dragon_King/status/1023483296439848961,1532852407

"Agreed. I support the players, but it is pretty funny to see the NFL players whine about it. We all have rules as work we hate that we have to follow. The NFL players are getting a taste of what it’s like to be a normal person, and they don’t like it. At all.

You are wrong it is the freedom of a business owner to run the business as it sees fit.  The government did not require this so it does not violate any freedoms.

"It's private enterprise. If they want to kneel, do it on their own time. If their BS is hurting the bottom line, that's the way it works.

"When Berom Christian youths block roads along Riyom, fish out Muslim-passersby & murder them, the Nigerian media suddenly become so modest with words, & call them ""locals"". The same way they call Christian militia groups in Benue & Taraba. Hypocrisy is your birth right.",D_RealOilsheikh,,https://twitter.com/D_RealOilsheikh/status/1011397499364335616,1529970929
"It has become fashionable for these Christian Youth in d North, particularly those in the 3 States mentioned & Kaduna.

"Each time this happened, their Elders, because of their closeness to the Press raised d alarm & cried ""ethnic cleansing"" and with a twinkle of the eye, the mainstream & online media were agog; their Pastors and Bishops shouted ""annihilation of Christians"" in the North! Very sad!",DanMinna,"DanMinna,D_RealOilsheikh",https://twitter.com/DanMinna/status/1011526097446621184,1530001589

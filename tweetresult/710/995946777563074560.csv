Did you know that there is a species of SA buck that can jump higher than the average house. This is due their powerful hind legs and the fact that the average house cannot jump.,pete_step_hens,,https://twitter.com/pete_step_hens/status/995946777563074560,1526287190
 the buck’s talent is hyperbolically praised by the house’s defaulted inability to compete. You can’t expect a greyhound & a cheetah to run the same race & hope the former will bring the element of surprise .,Toeknii,pete_step_hens,https://twitter.com/Toeknii/status/996240105328259072,1526357125

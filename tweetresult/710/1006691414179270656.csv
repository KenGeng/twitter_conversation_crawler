Lesson here about wasting time on pointless arguments/conflicts. Direct energy where it can make a real difference.,action_science,DamianProsa,https://twitter.com/action_science/status/1006721179955146752,1528856007

"The Cheetah would run just fast enough to eat the slowest dog, this is why it did not bother racing.

"The cheetah would lose if the race was really short and it was run on a small greyhound track. If it was a longer race in an open field obviously the cheetah would win, but not there.",Everylastdime,"DamianProsa,EdLatimore",https://twitter.com/Everylastdime/status/1006696384827777024,1528850096

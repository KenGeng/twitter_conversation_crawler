"Survive the brutality of the flu only to step outside for the first time in 3 days for some fresh air, nearly step on a rather large snake that slithered across the grass and scared me so bad that I tripped, nearly fell AND I cough-farted at the same time. ,#,ItsAlwaysSomething",lovinlyrics,,https://twitter.com/lovinlyrics/status/966710560665538560,1519316732

That reminds me of one time I was rafting down the Meramec River. There's a natural water spring I always like to stop at. As I was filling my water I looked down and there was a copperhead snake. It scared the bejeebers out of me. Luckily for me he had a fish in his mouth.,cindyh24681012,lovinlyrics,https://twitter.com/cindyh24681012/status/966735270258331652,1519322624

"At all levels of govt it seems the LNP vision for Australia is a barren, treeless wasteland broken up by the occasional coal mine, highway or pokie palace..everyone is either a coal miner or a barista on a zero hour contract with no healthcare, no prospects struggling to pay rent",SeanBradbery,,https://twitter.com/SeanBradbery/status/970423855759081472,1520202051

"I donâ€™t get how they could possibly believe such a dystopian future could work out for them in a positive way.

"Clearly I'm joking but I do think the LNP lack any positive vision for the future because they are broken and bought by vested interests and that they assume that the planet is an infinite resource, which will cost us all in the long run.",SeanBradbery,Schminkiepinkie,https://twitter.com/SeanBradbery/status/970476629586731008,1520214633
"We all hope that this stops at the joking level, of course. But whatâ€™s the tipping point? How far do we allow these cock-gobblers to go before we do whatever is necessary to halt it?",Schminkiepinkie,SeanBradbery,https://twitter.com/Schminkiepinkie/status/970477287148699648,1520214790

"Succinctly sums up LNPâ€™s 2farthings worth & bleak, barren tunnel vision.

Welcome to the new Australia created for you by LNP. Turnbull hides money in Caymans. Bishop flies not partner around for $35000 and wears very expensive jewellery â€˜givenâ€™ to her.

"I often wonder what their vision for the future is. They never articulate it. 
Because itâ€™s totally abhorrent. 
It also involves a feudal system of extreme privilege & luxury (for them) and abject poverty & desperation for the seething mass of cockroaches thatâ€™s the rest of us.",Aitch_El,SeanBradbery,https://twitter.com/Aitch_El/status/970449368556781568,1520208134

LNP leaders always seem to be at loss for words when asked for their vision for Australia.

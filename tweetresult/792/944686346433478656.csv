Australia Day! Keep the date...rename Welcome to Australia Day...chance to give First Peoples pivotal role of welcomers...then settlers reps can welcome “new australians”...maybe moment silence for those politically excluded. Sing Advance Australia Fair Go.,FatherBob,,https://twitter.com/FatherBob/status/944686346433478656,1514065751
Sorry Father but I think the whole point of moving it was that certain ppl were not welcome and then committed genocide.,kekule6,FatherBob,https://twitter.com/kekule6/status/944690203662225408,1514066670
I’m saying...redeem the day...rebadge it...the point of who’s who will be dramatically made.,FatherBob,kekule6,https://twitter.com/FatherBob/status/944693778941485058,1514067523
I'm inclined to think any rebadging of the day will be seen by Indigenous persons as an attempt to illegitimise their perception of it.  A sort of conceptual invasion. Sometimes the right motive can still produce the wrong result.,Left_in_Limbo,"FatherBob,kekule6",https://twitter.com/Left_in_Limbo/status/944701013117648896,1514069247

"except it ws colonisation that occurred that day, the settlers weren't 'welcoming' a permanent stay-the day still resonates w loss of identity-spirit; interesting thought pattern but I think it bends the reality of events trying to give ipositive spin/morphing it into a positive",raelene_west,FatherBob,https://twitter.com/raelene_west/status/944692790495195136,1514067287
Rewrite history to suit our current need of one people...the Greeks used it a lot ...called drama...call everyone together in the open theatre then re enact the vexatious event...then experience catharsis...then euphoria. Viola!,FatherBob,raelene_west,https://twitter.com/FatherBob/status/944696275768717313,1514068118
Welcome To Australia Day is a nice thought. Maybe all the money spent on it should be given to indigenous organisations to run a day of celebration of some sort.,Looby007,FatherBob,https://twitter.com/Looby007/status/944765674412371969,1514084664

Let the cottage industry devoted 24/7 to guilt do their thing.

"Agree with you here, Bob. Think its a great opportunity to recognise wrong doing, mourn with our first people. Then to turn to the future, with hopefulness.

That's just rewriting history.. There was no welcoming to Australia from Indigenous peoples. Certainly isn't now judging by our treatment of refugees. Hyperbole.,ginmarier,FatherBob,https://twitter.com/ginmarier/status/944712019260796928,1514071871

"Bob you cant just whitewash history and rewrite it to make it sound better.
Do you refuse to acknowledge the legitimate thoughts, feelings, and emotions that many of our First Nation People experience around 26 Jan?

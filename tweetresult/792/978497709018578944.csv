"so the witch hunt continues. It feels more and more that the reason they are been so heavily criticised is because they admitted it.

Only the ignorant can say that any ball tampering in the history was a solo act. Tell me a ball is being scuffed won't all the bowlers in side know which he side is being worked on.

"The truth is that all teams push the line. Some are more blatant than others but that doesn’t change the fact that they are altering the condition of the ball.

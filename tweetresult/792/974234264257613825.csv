Good day Shahan.Normally I love your program & always have it on, in the background.
Today I was disappointed with your behavior towards yr guest Dr Burger re farm murders
You came across prejudiced.
You asked what proof he had- just Google farm murders!",GoldensPam,"eNCA,ShahanR,issafrica",https://twitter.com/GoldensPam/status/974242434644434945,1521112471

"I absolutely agree.  All crime is bad. Imagine being asked if that statement was true...!?
This was a question that Shahan put to dr. Burger. When Dr. Burger responded yes, that the ,#,FarmMurders, were bad.. Shahan reacted with disbelief &asked where was his proof.

So you are saying that if Section 25 is amended the current white farmers won't have to leave their land? Are the new owners going to live with the old owners?

"We have GAINED,the unbelievable burden of our family mourning for us
We gained maturity and understanding of the world well beyond our years
Many of us sought safety of Aus when we were just boys and now we are men
But men with heavy hearts and knowledge of the worst of humanity.",ZazaiWalid,,https://twitter.com/ZazaiWalid/status/946994740905394177,1514616115

"I am endlessly sorry you had to endure this!

Remember 5 years ago when you were told you would never come to Australia? Maybe you should ask the people who encouraged you to ‘hang on’ why they lied to you.

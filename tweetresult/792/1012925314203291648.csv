"You hit the “nail on the button” about time someone had the balls to say something. The best junior players should be playing against each over every week. Get the better players into the top 12 NPL clubs in each state, & we might start to produce some better players.",GaryMarocchi,adampeacock3,https://twitter.com/GaryMarocchi/status/1012936392173899776,1530337829
Really good article Adam. The resources need to be sent to the right places to ensure future success. My brother was scouted by a rep club once upon a time but my parents couldn’t afford the fees.,Matt2146,adampeacock3,https://twitter.com/Matt2146/status/1012934915866832896,1530337478
"A-league needs to move back to winter. The football is ugly, it’s not the players fault. It’s hard to “play” football in Australian heat",dc_manintheknow,adampeacock3,https://twitter.com/dc_manintheknow/status/1012933139079917568,1530337054
"Fair dose of common sense in that article ,@,adampeacock3,. Maybe we need you in a different role which has more influence on outcomes.

"1/2 Great article Adam, has been something spoken about for a while. Funnel funds and resources into grassroots and the people who influence them (coaches etc) to ensure they get the best start and it’s a massive step.

"Excellent, Adam. We need to produce top quality players. Then we can have the philosophical argument about the approach we take. Arguments in the media about tactics take for granted that we have sufficient talent. We don’t. But I’d love to see the next Viduka, Kewell etc.",PhillipMetaxas,adampeacock3,https://twitter.com/PhillipMetaxas/status/1012929539175923712,1530336196

Aren't the students spies and potential threat to our democratic society? And China does't want them to come here to influence us? Isn't it good news to Australia? So why complain? How could we be pleased? More or fewer Chinese students? Welcome their money but not them??,JuliaHan7,"jiehyunglo,jleibold",https://twitter.com/JuliaHan7/status/964344945594089473,1518752726

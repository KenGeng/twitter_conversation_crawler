"To all those sponsors abandoning Cricket Australia, Dave Warner and Steve Smith, I have an idea: SPONSOR THE WOMEN OF ,#,AFLW,. They've forged a new market of sports followers, are admired by young girls, boys, women & men, play P/T & would love to go pro. It'd be a real statement.",Kate_Seear,,https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979147068408131584,1522281827
"Yes, all great ideas. My point is that the money can and should be redirected to needy areas - women's sport in particular.",Kate_Seear,,https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979177361164783616,1522289049
Yes granted I suggested AFLW because that’s in desperate need of money but I complete accept that there are many deserving women’s sports. My point is that the sponsors should consider redirecting the money elsewhere.,Kate_Seear,,https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979533088278568960,1522373861
Good Q.,Kate_Seear,,https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979545610603778048,1522376847
"Why does it have to be sport specific? The players in the truly world class ,@,WLeague, and ,@,TheMatildas, are deserving of far more than they currently get and don't have the support of the mega rich AFL and AFL biased local media",micknickbrewer,Kate_Seear,https://twitter.com/micknickbrewer/status/979154343885643776,1522283562
There’s pretty significant differences between AFLW and AFLM though. They cannot possibly be lumped together for these purposes. A reorientation to women’s sport of any kind would be terrific.,Kate_Seear,"micknickbrewer,WLeague,TheMatildas",https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979160574272524288,1522285047
I'm an aussie rules and soccer fan and i'd argue that women's soccer needs funding more for a range of reasons (participation being a huge one); the Matilda's specifically are a truly world class team that the whole nation can get behind and a lot of the girls are still semi-pro.,micknickbrewer,"Kate_Seear,WLeague,TheMatildas",https://twitter.com/micknickbrewer/status/979162497641988097,1522285506
That’s essentially my point.,Kate_Seear,"micknickbrewer,WLeague,TheMatildas",https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979163265921007616,1522285689
"Um, but what about the ,@,SouthernStars,?? What the men have done should not affect the women.",DanielleWarby,"Kate_Seear,Kate_ohalloran",https://twitter.com/DanielleWarby/status/979149823289929728,1522282484
Absolutely; great point.,Kate_Seear,"DanielleWarby,Kate_ohalloran,SouthernStars",https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979150660032610304,1522282683
I think that's a pretty poor thing to say really. Don't kick others when bigging up yourself,CountdownAus,"Kate_Seear,LizGiuffre",https://twitter.com/CountdownAus/status/979486612009570304,1522362780
"I’m not kicking anyone actually. I’m imploring the sponsors to not leave sport altogether, but to redirect their money elsewhere.",Kate_Seear,"CountdownAus,LizGiuffre",https://twitter.com/Kate_Seear/status/979532782320861184,1522373788
By all means appeal to sponsors for the sport but don't piggyback off others misfortune,CountdownAus,"Kate_Seear,LizGiuffre",https://twitter.com/CountdownAus/status/979534047545208833,1522374090
Let’s remember though that ‘cricket’ isn’t just the men’s game. An important point to show support for the culture and who it represents and includes,LizGiuffre,"CountdownAus,Kate_Seear",https://twitter.com/LizGiuffre/status/979800526953984001,1522437624
"There is no AFLM. Only the AFL. It's not gender discriminatory, you just have to be good enough.  Sponsorships aren't donations, they are investments for a return, AFLW doesn't have the interest to generate that return.",thommo81,"Kate_Seear,WLudbey",https://twitter.com/thommo81/status/979266120690495488,1522310211

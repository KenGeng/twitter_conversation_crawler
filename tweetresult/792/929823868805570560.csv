"An oldie but a goody. You'll be pleased to hear I spent 35 years teaching in high schools and universities so no doubt that makes me not only a ""Cultural Marxist"" in your eyes but a bludger warping the mind of innocents. Nice try on misdirection though.",Prufrockery,"ivehadenough97,ZazaiWalid",https://twitter.com/Prufrockery/status/929879107742998528,1510535430

"They passed through many countries that are considered safe.
They attempted to enter the country illegally!

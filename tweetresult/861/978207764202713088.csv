"Just shooting observations in case anything triggers with anyone.

- Doughnut's eyes aren't X-ed out like the other children's, they're just scratched.
- Spring only has one eye X-ed out, not two like the other children.

"Servil is a lower personality routine that Binkx normally supercedes, except when her body is in some dire situation. At least, as I understand it.

"A long shot, but I showed the first image around the archives today. Knowles recognized it... it's from a UK children's show called ""Here Come the Double Deckers"", about a gang of adventurous children. The two who aren't crossed out are, I think, Scooper and Sticks. ,@,HyelMartel",tsw_JEvans,KMExMachina,https://twitter.com/tsw_JEvans/status/978472287169953792,1522120947

"Maybe a spiderwebbed window? I don't know the show, but it seems that the kids used the bus as their hideout, from which they launched their adventures.

Scoop was the gang's leader.
Sticks was the show's concession to an American investor... an American actor. He played drums.",tsw_JEvans,"lilcordite,Hazel_Witch5",https://twitter.com/tsw_JEvans/status/978476727239192577,1522122005
"Scoop is the one in the middle of the group, yeah? Not the one off to the side?

You know, now that I think of it? He kind of looks like that kid who hangs around the trashed skate park in Kingsmouth.

"No, I've never seen that image before.

I don't even think I was alive at that time. I have no idea why she'd be projecting an image like that. It's a little bizarre.

The second one? That's — a little more troubling.",HyelMartel,"CalMickC,KMExMachina",https://twitter.com/HyelMartel/status/978332411220996096,1522087598

"Binkx's soul is constructed of several animal and human spirits — each embodies a certain aspect of her personality that manifests through her, or preforms a specific task.

One of them is a spider.

"I mentioned earlier to ,@,CalMickC, that the only spider-connection I know of with Binkx is the fact that one of the spirits that make up her soul is that of a Spider.

The threads of her web tie the many facets of Binkx's soul together.

It's an image that doesn't bode well.",HyelMartel,"Hazel_Witch5,KlausvonRichter,KMExMachina",https://twitter.com/HyelMartel/status/978467667278352386,1522119845
"Indeed. The web seems frozen in the picture, which does not seem good in that context.

Or it's glass that has spiderwebbed cracked, but the spider in the center also makes that ominous.",Hazel_Witch5,"HyelMartel,KlausvonRichter",https://twitter.com/Hazel_Witch5/status/978471132302061573,1522120671

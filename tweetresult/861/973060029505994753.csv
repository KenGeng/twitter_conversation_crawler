"Jimin is a college kid, driving home from a really long day of dance practice. It's nearly dawn when he's finished. He accidently skids off the road and almost dies. 

Almost...

Someone saves him, an angel with gossamer wings and converse high tops. Only, no one believes him.,pic.twitter.com/NokRE3CJcV",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973060029505994753,1520830564
"Jimin is tired. He can barely keep his eyes open. He knows he shouldn't be driving, but he's five minutes away from campus. Nothing can go wrong right? He yawns and tears gloss over his eyes reflexively.

He reaches for his coffee in the cup holder but accidentally spills it.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973349803383033856,1520899651
"In the second his eyes leave the road and get back to it, a person appears in front of him. It's so early in the morning, who'd be walking around-

He knows he's not going to stop in time. Jimin swerves off the road and hits the rail, only he happened to be going over a bridge.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973350600883757056,1520899841
"Everything is processed in slides, like in those old classroom projectors. Jimin's completely frozen as the water below rushes toward him.

Spider web cracks in the windshield.

His seatbelt won't come loose.

The water, the shards of glass in his arm.

Is he going to die?",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973351303912017920,1520900009
"There's someone in the water with him, too beautiful to be real. He pulls off the car door, rips out Jimin's seat belt and pulls him up.

Jimin needs air. He inhales automatically, filling his lungs with burning water. His vision goes black.

What's going on? Did he die?",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973352332829364225,1520900254
"When Jimin comes to, someone is compressing his chest and kissing him? Giving his lungs short bursts of air.

CPR

Jimin coughs, lungs on fire.

""Ah, fuck, thank god."" a voice hums above him.

Jimin's mind races, sunlight blaring in his eyes. They're back on the bridge somehow.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973353297540255745,1520900484
"""H-how did we get here?"" Jimin asks, voice sounding like sandpaper.

The dancer tries to ID his rescuer. Pastel converse shoes, ripped up jeans, a varsity jacket, the most gorgeous face he's ever seen, wet blond hair clinging to his forehead.

Wings.

The guy has gossamer wings.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973354183276548096,1520900695
"""You... wings,"" Jimin says, black eating at his vision.

""Hey,"" the boy answers softly. ""You're gonna be okay. I promise.""

Sirens sound in the distant. The boy gets spooked. He cups Jimin's face in his hand. ""I have to go. I'm sorry.""

Then he rockets into the air, disappearing.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973355096326262784,1520900913
"God, the sky... it's so blue.

Jimin loses consciousness. He feels oddly warm, despite being completely drenched.

He wakes up to periodic beeping, and the hiss of some sort of pump.

""Jimin?"" a distance voice calls.

He's in a hospital bed, feeling surprisingly okay. ""Tae?""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973355697781035008,1520901057
"His best friend is hovering above him. ""Jimin! What happened?""

""I-I accidently skid off a bridge."" Jimin answers.

Tae looks confused.

""How are you? Does it hurt anywhere?"" Tae asks. ""I'll get the nurse.""

""I'm fine,"" Jimin hums. ""Someone saved me.""

""Someone?""

""An angel.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973356500029726720,1520901248
"A day later, Jimin is discharged. The police question him. Jimin sticks with his initial claim. They chalk it up to a hallucination.

Well. somebody had to save him from the water and fly him back up the twenty foot fall.

""It was an angel,"" Jimin insists.

""It wasn't, you were-""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973357206925201409,1520901416
"No one believes him. Not even his best friend.

""Look, he even left a mark on me,"" Jimin says. looking around before pulling up the hem of his shorts.

""You got a rainbow feather tattoo?"" Taehyung asks, observing the thing.

""No!"" Jimin hisses. ""The angel put this on me.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973357771193188352,1520901551
"""Jimin, you need to let this go, you sound crazy."" Tae answers. ""You sound crazy. You're scaring me.""

Jimin sighs frustratedly. He decided to keep his story to himself, until he can find proof. He searches the crash site for evidence.... but there's nothing.

Damn...",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973358290649387008,1520901675
"Jimin's late for dance class. He'll look for more clues later. 

That night, he stretches in class, waiting for the instructor, mind filling with second thoughts. Maybe it was a dream. What kind of angel would wear Converses?

A new kid walks in and tosses his bag on the bench.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973359029572521984,1520901851
"The instructor, Jung Hoseok, follows right behind him.

""Class, I'd like to introduce a new student,"" Hoseok calls the class to attention, ""Min Yoongi.""

Jimin's eyes flicker upward and time stops.

It's him. It's the angel. Only, he doesn't have wings.

But it's definitely him!",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973359811185315840,1520902037
"Yoongi looks at Jimin. For a split second, he looks surprised, before he hides it with a cough. He takes a seat in the corner. Jimin keeps looking at him, hoping to catch his eye.

But he doesn't look back at Jimin.

It's him. It's got to be him though.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973360368335630336,1520902170
"During practice, heat prickles uncomfortably on Jimin's skin. Whether he's dancing or watching Yoongi dance. 

Maybe he can't reveal himself? He's afraid for some reason?

Jimin decides that he'll ask after class and also, casually thank him. 

Why is his heart beating so fast?",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973360881722683395,1520902293
"Damn, Yoongi's beautiful. Jimin's memory did the man no justice. His skin is like porcelain, and his eyes are so intense. He doesn't have his wings, but when he dances, he flies.

After class, Jimin tentatively approaches him, stomach in knots.

""Hi.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973361582364332032,1520902460
"The man looks utterly annoyed. ""Bye.""

""Wait,"" Jimin calls a little too loud, which is fine, only the instructor's there, everyone else is gone.

Jimin clears his throat and lowers his voice. ""Thank you for saving me. I dunno why you're pretending, but I won't tell anyone.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973362442758774784,1520902665
"""I have no idea what you're talking about,"" Yoongi answers, flushing pink, trying to get past Jimin.

""Well, okay,"" Jimin says, pulling up his tights. showing him the feather tattoo. ""Can you at least tell me what this is? Do I have to be worried.""

Yoongi looks flustered.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973363961608499200,1520903027
"""Jimin,"" Hoseok shouts. ""Shouldn't you be getting home?""

Jimin jumps from the noise, gives Yoongi a fleeting look. He whispers. ""I'll see you next week? Please? I won't tell.""

""Won't tell what?"" Yoongi continues playing dumb.

""I won't tell people that you're an angel.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973364613600432129,1520903182
"Yoongi chokes on nothing. Hoseok calls Jimin again. The boy hurriedly bows, ""I'll see you next week, teacher.""

Then he leaves. Okay, that was terrible. He made the worst, most crazy impression. Yoongi's probs regretting saving his life right about now. Gah, how mortifying.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973365570207977473,1520903410
"Jimin's halfway out the building when he realizes that he forgot his phone. He turns back around, terrified of facing Yoongi again.

He nears the room and hears two people arguing quietly. It's Yoongi and the teacher.

JImin hides behind the wall, hoping not to be spotted.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973366247311147008,1520903572
"He can get his phone back once they leave right?

""I can't believe you'd reveal yourself to a human, Yoongi. You broke so many Fae rules.""

""I had to Hobi! He was gonna die.""

""That's not your business.""

""He doesn't know anything. He thinks I'm an angel for crying out loud.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973366872191234048,1520903721
"""And what about your mark? You gave it to him.... to a mortal.""

""He wasn't gonna make it. You should have seen him when I pulled him from the water. He had glass everywhere. It was-""

""That mark was meant for your mate. Do you know what this means?""

""Yes.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973367571327148033,1520903887
"""If you can't get him to love you, you'll die,""

""I know.""

""So what are you gonna do?""

""I-I still have a few years before-""

""Are you serious?""

""I can't force someone to love me. I'm not even human. I think he's probably keen on that.""

""You fucking idiot.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973368032285351937,1520903997
"""I had to save him. It was my fault he drove off in the first place.""

""So now what? You're just gonna die?""

""I-""

Jimin sneezes. 

Ah damn.

""What was that?""

Suddenly, Jimin's staring two Fairies down, which is way scarier than it sounds.

To be continued.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973369584140111877,1520904367
"Jimin wakes up in a very comfortable bed. He doesn't even remember falling asleep. Immediately, he know he's not home.

This is the most luxurious room he's ever seen. Outside, there's people with wings walking around, and like- all these fruit trees, what the fu-

""Jimin?""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973761702461308933,1520997856
"""Don't be scared,"" Yoongi hums.

""You guys kidnapped me and brought me to some sort of magical fairy world,"" Jimin guesses.

Yoongi has a very alert/uncomfortable face. ""Alright, let me explain. I'm working hard on getting you out of here. Two days tops.""

Seriously!?",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973762730778865664,1520998101
"""I'm leaving,"" Jimin hisses. ""Right now.""

Yoongi nods for a moment, eyes wide. ""I'm so sorry. Hoseok was the one who took you here. I tried to stop him. And now my father won't let you leave. But-But I'm working on it.""

""Who died and made your father the king?""

""My grandpa.""",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973763353616281600,1520998249
"It took Jimin a few moments to understand it. ""So, you're a prince, a fairy prince.""

""We prefer Fae, but yes,"" Yoongi says quickly. ""Look, you just have to comply for a few days, go to the feast-""

""What feast?"" Jimin hisses.

""There's a feast in your honor-"" Yoongi begins.",CenCenAO3,,https://twitter.com/CenCenAO3/status/973764235938459649,1520998460

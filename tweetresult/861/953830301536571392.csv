"I'm wanting crowdsource some ideas on Hands of the King. I think there was an important Hand figure from the first Long Night that we can try to isolate. Or maybe not. 

Any symbolism folks that have a thought jump in because I'm pretty scattered on it.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953830301536571392,1516245839
"First one: The King dreams and the Hand builds. 

This one seems pretty straightforward. It is telling us about a king in the net, the king of ashes, who has a Hand figure on the outside who I guess builds things for him.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953830861404868608,1516245973
"He may even skinchange or more subtly influence this individual. In my head I imagine it like Bran's relationship with Theon. We have one king, Jaehaerys who has a septon for a Hand. One thought I have is that this Hand on the outside could be like a high priest/prophet.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953831900325535745,1516246221
"Theon seems to be following Aeron's footsteps in prophet-hood after suffering, but with the Old Gods. 

George has written before about damaged men being more susceptible to psychic influence.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953832417156005888,1516246344
"Of course Euron tells Aeron to worship him like a god and openly says he will become a god. 

So you can tell I think the Grey King may be this Hand since that is what those two are.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953832893805146112,1516246457
"Next one: The King eats and the Hand takes the shit. This is another form of the last and may say the same thing, or tell the real truth, or just more if the truth.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953833267136000000,1516246546
"Regarding ASoIaF, anytime I see anything about shit, I of course think of ,@,RRavenousreader,.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953833578525323264,1516246621
"I mean she has this whole ""back door"" theory I don't fully understand where the Others or maybe other things that come from the trees are like the ""shit"" of the tree. 

Even though I don't really understand it, I do see glimpses of this being true.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953834031606583297,1516246729
"Connecting the two, the hypothetical king in the net, who last time was dreaming, eating would refer to blood sacrifice. That's sounds like it adds up. So how then does the Hand take the shit? Not sure.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953834675465793538,1516246882
"Euron was the king with Aeron as this Hand/prophet in my flawed, messy headcannon a second ago. Euron definitely gives Aeron a lot shit.

He also compares his baseborn children to the contents of his chamber pot. So is the shit the Hand must deal with in some way his bastards?",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953835519703740417,1516247083
"Hands of Robert, Ned and Jon, certainly have to deal with his.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953835799237283841,1516247150
Which brings us to number three: Hands of gold are always cold.,UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953836031081631744,1516247205
"There are at least two types of kings in terms of symbolism, gold crown and black crown. Robert is summer/oak gold king. His hands are both wintery cold. This doesn't hold up for all in history, but do gold crown kings have cold Hands in an archetypal sense?",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953836623707426817,1516247347
Does the losing king is a holly/oak duel become the Hand subservient to the winner? Probly not but I keep coming back to that.,UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953837054391214080,1516247449
"Then back to Euron for a moment, he seems to be at times a Night's King wintery king, but also to me at least, a corrupted summer king. Either way, his Hands are mostly Vic (Balon's strong right arm) and also *just maybe* Aeron.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953837686317617152,1516247600
"Both are Grey King figures I think. Aeron obviously, Vic is a champ of the Old Way and has some grey hair, even though Euron does not so maybe him too.

Eu, as in Euron, can mean gold. And the Grey King is colored grey like a winter sea.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953838463475965953,1516247785
"So is this a Hand of gold being cold? 

Coldhands may be like Bloodraven's Hand. Bloodraven is like a king in/of the net/ashes.",UnchainedASoIaF,,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953838911448592385,1516247892
"It is the little brother, AA.  Like Stannis, like Maegor, like Daemon Targaryen, like Tyrion.  The little brother is meant to be subservient, a lesser figure, the one who takes the shit.  There are a ton of examples.",Crowfood_sD,UnchainedASoIaF,https://twitter.com/Crowfood_sD/status/953860171607846912,1516252961
I cannot explain how much I like seeing you agree. Hands are the driving force behind the story. There was an important one I am pretty sure. But who was it an how does he relate to his king? Which age of heroes folks were Hand and who was the king?,UnchainedASoIaF,Crowfood_sD,https://twitter.com/UnchainedASoIaF/status/953861191033610240,1516253204

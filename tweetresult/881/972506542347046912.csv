"Unpopular opinion: the shinning is a shitty movie.

Hate to be the guy who says “the book is better than the movie” but there is a COMPLETELY different series of events. It’s hardly the same story. One of the greatest books of all time, the movie just can’t compete.",CodeOrangeDads,,https://twitter.com/CodeOrangeDads/status/972506542347046912,1520698602
"Foreal, it’s not just a few differences either: different endings, different character’s fates, different character’s experiences with the house, replacement of significant events. It’s just doesn’t even come close to the book y’all.",CodeOrangeDads,,https://twitter.com/CodeOrangeDads/status/972507675949924352,1520698872
"Also I DONT CARE ABOUT THE AESTHETIC OKAY. Don’t tell me I have to respect it. I’m not going to love a movie just because of the way it looks.

I like Kubrick, I think he’s amazing but he’s done MUCH better movies. It’s easily his most overrated work.",CodeOrangeDads,,https://twitter.com/CodeOrangeDads/status/972510696310272005,1520699593
Hard agree but also the movie as a stand alone is good you should watch the documentary they did about the shinning and how it ties in with the fake moon landing theory! But also I love Stanley Kubrick,TPemelton,CodeOrangeDads,https://twitter.com/TPemelton/status/972547701924679680,1520708415

"If you've ever wondered what a real American conspiracy would look like, fear not, history provides examples. The FBI assassination of Fred Hampton is particularly instructive. ,https://,en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hamp,ton, ,…",grasshopperpie,,https://twitter.com/grasshopperpie/status/975510697177067520,1521414848
"Some hallmark features of this conspiracy include:
-decades later, the truth is out, though there's been little to no accountability
-the truth wasn't hard to figure out right away. All you had to do was dig beneath the racist veneer of the media",grasshopperpie,,https://twitter.com/grasshopperpie/status/975511735112105984,1521415096
"-govt agencies at odds with each other (an American specialty- don't believe any conspiracy that doesn't have this feature)
-a clear agenda (racism in this case)
-terrible execution of a plan (the police leaving evidence all over the place & not bothering to get stories straight)",grasshopperpie,,https://twitter.com/grasshopperpie/status/975512578859319297,1521415297
Your JFK assassinations and your Stanley Kubrick moon landings don't have any of these features. They're made up. Don't waste your time with fake conspiracies when the US govt has been overthrowing regimes abroad and at home for a hundred years with little fanfare.,grasshopperpie,,https://twitter.com/grasshopperpie/status/975513360010653696,1521415483
"If there were one tenth as many videos and blogs about the time the FBI engaged in political assassination of a US citizen and no jury would convict them, as there were about steel beams not melting, the world would be a better place.",grasshopperpie,,https://twitter.com/grasshopperpie/status/975514143355621377,1521415670

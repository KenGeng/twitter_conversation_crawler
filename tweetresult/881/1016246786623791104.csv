"We never went to the moon. If you dig into the science of it, it's actually a ridiculous notion.,https://,twitter.com/nopoweradeinus,a/status/1015482523621605377, ,…",MarthaTheZealot,,https://twitter.com/MarthaTheZealot/status/1016246786623791104,1531127089
Please tell me this is satire...,JeffCassman,MarthaTheZealot,https://twitter.com/JeffCassman/status/1016375612037124096,1531157803
No way! ,MarthaTheZealot,JeffCassman,https://twitter.com/MarthaTheZealot/status/1016713508300447744,1531238364
Wait...you seriously do not believe we've been to the moon?,JeffCassman,MarthaTheZealot,https://twitter.com/JeffCassman/status/1016812475872894976,1531261960

So you think all the nations of the world-including the Soviets-covered up our lie about going to the moon at the height of the Cold War?  And that they continue to cover up for us?,JeffCassman,MarthaTheZealot,https://twitter.com/JeffCassman/status/1017051479725740033,1531318943
"Why would they know? Not many people would have to be in on it. 

My phone data is just about out, otherwise I'd send the clip of the interview when they 'got back'. It speaks for itself. There's so much wrong with it. Come over and we'll have a beer. ",MarthaTheZealot,JeffCassman,https://twitter.com/MarthaTheZealot/status/1017056225664659456,1531320074
"The Russians, the Chinese, the Indians...and in the four decades since, virtually the entire world.  You really believe the governments of all these nations helped us to cover up a faked moon landing?  And they are STILL covering it up for us?  Why?",JeffCassman,MarthaTheZealot,https://twitter.com/JeffCassman/status/1017056675721867265,1531320182
"They didn't help anything. They don't know. It was a save-face move after we'd talked big about it. It was important for the world to see that the US was no. 1. Space race y'know. And we've never been able to get back. ,

I could start enumerating impossibilities if you'd like.",MarthaTheZealot,JeffCassman,https://twitter.com/MarthaTheZealot/status/1017058354697592832,1531320582
"as a computer scientist, i can tell you without a doubt that we did not have the computer technology in 1969 to land a man on moon and return him alive. 
Is it absolutely impossible, from a testing and failure rate point of view, that absolutely nothing went wrong on apollo 11.",albertcasaletto,MarthaTheZealot,https://twitter.com/albertcasaletto/status/1016250502684655616,1531127975
Right. How about the super hi-def and immediate radio transmissions?! ,MarthaTheZealot,albertcasaletto,https://twitter.com/MarthaTheZealot/status/1016318648498212864,1531144222
I believe it was done in a studio haha.,LaValette123,MarthaTheZealot,https://twitter.com/LaValette123/status/1016247742849404928,1531127317
"There's a clip of a NASA scientist saying that they hope someday to figure out how to get through the Van Allen Radiation Belt and get to the moon. , Oops.

My favorite is how, in the 60's, the 'transmissions' from space were like hi-def.",MarthaTheZealot,LaValette123,https://twitter.com/MarthaTheZealot/status/1016249747127046144,1531127795

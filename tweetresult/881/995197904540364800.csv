"the moon landing on july 20, 1969 was faked: a conspiracy theory thread,pic.twitter.com/9ZuoI2Db7H",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995197904540364800,1526108644
"as always, a disclaimer:
this is all information ive gathered from various websites, articles, videos & photos and ""witnesses"" claims. i honestly dont know if it was faked but its up for you to decide!! so let's begin,pic.twitter.com/q4AcYAreWW",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995198716075274241,1526108838
"there's sort of alot that goes into this theory, and there's alot of different theories about the faked moon landing. but im just gonna cover the biggest parts and the most viral",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995199054828265472,1526108919
"soo, apparently on july 20 1969 astronauts neil armstrong, michael collins and edwin ""buzz"" aldrin were the first humans to set foot on the moon and plant the american flag on it,pic.twitter.com/DSMWmpGxdw",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995200324385329152,1526109221
"ok ok so the first thing comes from a ""cameraman"" who apparently shot the fake moon landing. his name was max canard, & he apparently helped director stanley kubrick film it",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995202633232257026,1526109772
"okay so if you dont know who stanley kubrick is, he was a famous director, writer & producer in the 20th century. he was known for working on films like the shining, lolita, spartacus,pic.twitter.com/stP66vu9sN",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995203141724508160,1526109893
"well APPARENTLY, this max canard moved to hollywood to be a filmmaker. it was there that he applied to work with stanley for one of his upcoming projects. after several confidentiality forms and contracts he finally got to work with him",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995203432473677824,1526109962
"stanley wanted to create a movie that was realistic with outer space and scifi, bc almost all movies in that time werent realistic. so he spent over 10.5 million dollars building the 2001: a space odyssey ""set"" (in the 60s 10 million is roughly equal to 84 million today).,pic.twitter.com/As9XUYwUsb",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995204680610271232,1526110260
"so before the film even began production, the set was built by several experts in technician, mechanics, artists, etc. it had to look real on camera and in real life",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995205192139370497,1526110382
"apparently, this is when the moon landing filming took place.  they brought in the fake spacecrafts, the astronauts, all of it. filming was said to have been in london, although some conspire it was filmed in area 51 or high up in the hollywood hills",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995206124738662402,1526110604
"heres the moon landing video,pic.twitter.com/6Rhz3OLMB1",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995206956976623618,1526110803
now many people believe this is fake because of the way hes moving around. on the moon you only experience 17% of the gravity we have here on earth. meaning theyre walking around with 83% of nothing lol. it'd be nearly impossible to hold themselves down like that,dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995207929614819330,1526111035
"also the fact that he hops multiple times, almost trying to seem like hes ""floating"" but if he were in outerspace and he hopped like that, many argue he really would float up",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995208118769418240,1526111080
"now NASA as well as the government and people who believe in the moon landing argue bc with todays technology, you can see the footprints on the moon and the flags placed there (there were multiple apollo missions after apollo 11's ""success"")",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995208509389201408,1526111173
"as well as legitimate moon rocks brought down to earth and photographs,pic.twitter.com/UyQdERyejx",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995208815221059584,1526111246
"however there were many known unmanned spacecrafts successfully launched on the moon that could very well, take photos and possibly collect moon rocks,pic.twitter.com/RevBUta98V",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995209077549608961,1526111308
"and as for the footprints, well there were multiple missions afterwards that were clearly successful to the moon. those footprints as well as the extra flag couldve easily been planted to cover up the hoax",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995209300086845440,1526111361
"in the photo that was taken, the flag appears to be waving, which many point out comes from airflow.. lol duh. but officials tried covering it up and saying he twisted the pole to get it into the rocks, and thats why the flag was moving,pic.twitter.com/mC4nMo8Ngu",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995210167406006272,1526111568
"now a little bit before the moon landing, the movie 2001: a space odyssey came out. and that REALLY got people talking. not only did the technology look familiar, but the set, the effects, the way they constructed outerspace for their film. it was proof it couldve been faked,pic.twitter.com/cwaS9ADNp1",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995210899773325313,1526111743
also the fact that in the moon landing pictures and videos there arent many stars present. if u go anywhere with little to no light pollution on earth.. the sky will be FULL of stars. thats on earth. in outer space they would surround you and be more visible,dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995211388279803905,1526111859
"but they still filmed the take off and had hours of radio conversations between the astronauts and the NASA facilities on earth,pic.twitter.com/V2CL6Cy59S",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995211868456280064,1526111974
if youre questioning why the US would fake such a thing when they knew that if they were patient they could succeed?? bc they were in a cold war with russia and they were in a race to the moon.. literally,dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995212119527317509,1526112034
"and by the US getting there first, that was seen as the US winning the cold war. ofc the cold war wasnt just about reaching the moon, there were other conflicts as well but this is a thread on the moon so,pic.twitter.com/32DdKrTHp0",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995212669320916992,1526112165
"soo thats it!! if u have more info or insight, pls feel free to comment below n add on!! try to keep it positive pls. and what do u think??",dracarysbby,,https://twitter.com/dracarysbby/status/995213173522423808,1526112285
"Okay but there Shouldn't be stars in the pictures , they weren't capable of capturing them with those cameras . Secondly the flag was ""waving"" from the momentum of the guy planting it not from a ""breeze"" if it were in a studio why would there be a breeze??",Fuji97932195,dracarysbby,https://twitter.com/Fuji97932195/status/996260262574411777,1526361930

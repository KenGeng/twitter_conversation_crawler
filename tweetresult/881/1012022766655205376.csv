I had Forrest Gump spoiled to me last night by my favorite podcast and almost cried into a bag containing 17 dollars worth of Taco Bell,zaaaaackali,,https://twitter.com/zaaaaackali/status/1012022766655205376,1530120004

Literally no one would give a fuck about Forrest Gump anymore if Frank Ocean never made a beautiful song with the same title,zaaaaackali,"zaaaaackali,kevinwhayne",https://twitter.com/zaaaaackali/status/1012088559694766081,1530135690
On that note who the fuck is Stanley Kubrick,zaaaaackali,"zaaaaackali,kevinwhayne",https://twitter.com/zaaaaackali/status/1012088644641976326,1530135711
Apparently frank ocean believes the moon landing was fake and he’s also a huge Stanley Kubrick fan,zaaaaackali,"jess_kirk,kevinwhayne",https://twitter.com/zaaaaackali/status/1012191772863320064,1530160298

After it happened I looked at him with a tear in my eye and he just shrugged and said “I tried”,zaaaaackali,jaywimzie,https://twitter.com/zaaaaackali/status/1012024981524504577,1530120532

I have the unpopular opinion of thinking Forrest Gump is extremely overrated but I’m RLY just tweeting here to say I’m glad im not the only one who ends up with bags of $17 worth of Taco Bell in my possession,LindsayASmith_,zaaaaackali,https://twitter.com/LindsayASmith_/status/1012228306127720448,1530169009

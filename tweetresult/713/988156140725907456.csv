"Sure it's pure easy to make the first ever recording of basking shark breeding any where in the world. They could have used some stock footage to...... Oooo wait, first ever time that has been filmed, anywhere!",RuairiOSiochain,ronanohall,https://twitter.com/RuairiOSiochain/status/988166337573908480,1524432188

 don’t take it personally! FYI I think the first time footage was the clip of the minkey whale behaviour. Can’t be 100% sure though.,ronanohall,RuairiOSiochain,https://twitter.com/ronanohall/status/988176817189158912,1524434687
Yeah it was the minkey whale tummy swelling behaviour.... Ruairí getting a bit carried away there with his cocky 'putdown' of your opinion.,farrellogara,"ronanohall,RuairiOSiochain",https://twitter.com/farrellogara/status/988186429091086336,1524436978
"1/4 Sorry late reply thx for comments Re sharks no repeat shots they just swim in circles in in courtship/pre-mating Could have filmed copulation also part of mating but was 40 feet down holding breath, had few secs to decide thought it may disturb them and poss bit tasteless",SeaFever2,ronanohall,https://twitter.com/SeaFever2/status/992405732808118273,1525442939

To be fair though it was only your man filming and he clearly had a fairly limited budget and resources,farrellogara,ronanohall,https://twitter.com/farrellogara/status/988186577284272128,1524437014

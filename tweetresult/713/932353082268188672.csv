"I didn't see the shark-feeding 
But
I'm willing to bet it wasn't as brutal as OUR species hunting and killing killing the whale then winching it's carcase up into our boat to slice it up with our massive blades to fit inside our blubber boilers ?",eppletonian,Telegraph,https://twitter.com/eppletonian/status/932389640438452228,1511133987
No second act indeed! The biggest horror is the unnatural plastic carelessly discarded!,Eileenf86333314,Telegraph,https://twitter.com/Eileenf86333314/status/932357729460654081,1511126379
I’d say my nightmares will be filled with albatross chicks being fed plastic and grieving pilot whales carrying their decaying babies actually. All the more horrifying as I know I’ve contributed to their demise.,RumSlattern,Telegraph,https://twitter.com/RumSlattern/status/932356825718185984,1511126164

"Working on a human-,#,polarbear, conflict paper & this photo had me wondering what Darwin would think about people with their back to 900 kg of carnivore at 50 m. Declining bear abundance in Hudson Bay suggests such tourism will end (unless the bears switch to tourist snacks?).,pic.twitter.com/LPtKrTbC5y",AEDerocher,,https://twitter.com/AEDerocher/status/963168177109663744,1518472162
"Because bears are losing fear of humans after frequent encounters during walking tours, Nunavut communities north of Manitoba have had to make more on-the-spot decisions in defence kills. Reports of recent kills in 2 communities alone total 8. Not helping the WHB bear population",Irngutaq,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/Irngutaq/status/963182299578695681,1518475529
"Habituation of ,#,polarbears, is an ongoing concern. The bears feed around sled dogs in Churchill then walk north to communities with dogs & cause problems: not good for the bears or people. Mutual respect & distance will help reduce habituation.",AEDerocher,Irngutaq,https://twitter.com/AEDerocher/status/963206881463300096,1518481390
"I just recalled something over 10 years ago. An elder who used dog team to hunt and go for close trips, had relocated his team to the bay ice with other mushers after bay freeze-up. Not long after that there was a bad blizzard and he discovered that his dogs were eaten by a bear",Irngutaq,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/Irngutaq/status/963509629824196608,1518553571
"Andrew scientists really shouldnt stoop to this. You’re data driven, no? How many polar bear tourists have been mauled by polar bears? This is like saying people shouldn’t swim in the ocean because “Sharks”.",CarlDonohue,"AEDerocher,JohnEMarriott",https://twitter.com/CarlDonohue/status/963175453564403712,1518473897
"Data? Maybe a peer reviewed paper? States ""Increased concern for both human and bear safety is warranted in light of predictions of increased numbers of nutritionally stressed bears spending longer amounts of time on land near people because of the loss of their sea ice habitat."",pic.twitter.com/xEZzCnbfNB",AEDerocher,"CarlDonohue,JohnEMarriott",https://twitter.com/AEDerocher/status/963197507109994496,1518479155
"""nearly all attacks involved 2 or fewer people"". How many involved a crowd that size?",CarlDonohue,"AEDerocher,JohnEMarriott",https://twitter.com/CarlDonohue/status/963198205931372544,1518479322
Maybe they were keeping lookout for bears coming from a distance? ,NinaHimes,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/NinaHimes/status/963204464139096064,1518480814
"Maybe, but the guides are on the look out & they carry guns. I don't see guns on my weakest-link nominees: I see tourists being tourists.",AEDerocher,NinaHimes,https://twitter.com/AEDerocher/status/963207819661987840,1518481614
"@,AndrewBarnas, ,@,yukondoug, ,@,RyanKBrook, We seem to be missing the implication of this photo that these bears are surrounded by people on either side. No escape route for bears, and now people are down range of guns if action is taken.",AndrewBarnas,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/AndrewBarnas/status/964161765528555521,1518709052
"100% correct. The other issue is that ,#,polarbears, try to escape to 1) water or 2) rough sea ice when threatened. The preferred exit path for the bears is blocked by tourists.",AEDerocher,"AndrewBarnas,yukondoug,RyanKBrook",https://twitter.com/AEDerocher/status/964173619273150466,1518711878
Were any of these unsafe tourism photos/observations in Ontario?,JayFitzsy,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/JayFitzsy/status/964182078681157633,1518713895
Unlikely. This form of tourism is centred in Manitoba but is spreading. Early attempts to regulate were stopped by special interest parties.,AEDerocher,JayFitzsy,https://twitter.com/AEDerocher/status/964190078921658369,1518715803
"Thanks. As a threatened species under Ontario's Endangered Species Act, harassment is prohibited. Exactly what would constitute harassment is another Q, but close-quarters tourism polar bear operations would merit evaluation for potential harassment, if they occurred in Ontario.",JayFitzsy,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/JayFitzsy/status/964199633357561862,1518718081
"We see this increasingly around Churchill, & we have concerns for the safety & wellbeing of both bears & people if foolish human behavior continues to go unchecked. Our field courses there strive to minimize impacts on bears & habitat & prevent bears learning bad habits from us.",greatbearfnd,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/greatbearfnd/status/963172899283611648,1518473288
"There are many more factors that influence outcomes of polar bear-human interactions and simplistic explanations won't get us very far: watch for upcoming publications by ,@,aimschmidt",yukondoug,"greatbearfnd,AEDerocher",https://twitter.com/yukondoug/status/963802223275794433,1518623331
Every year I teach field courses along Hudson Bay and talk a lot about polar bear safety - I am absolutely using this photo to highlight every possible mistake that should be avoided. By the way I don’t blame the group (though they should know better)- it’s the guide(s).,RyanKBrook,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/RyanKBrook/status/964171688085630976,1518711418
"You’re assigning blame? For what, exactly? None of us know anything about what is going on in that image. Pretending we do is not a helpful or useful instruction at all.",CarlDonohue,"RyanKBrook,AEDerocher",https://twitter.com/CarlDonohue/status/964270725044449280,1518735030
"Yes I am. Not trying to be helpful except to my own students who I lead and set an example for in polar bear country and I'm ultimately responsible for their safety. The key failures are clear here, but sure, specifics open to some discussion -always learn from talking about it.",RyanKBrook,"CarlDonohue,AEDerocher",https://twitter.com/RyanKBrook/status/964273115407642624,1518735600
"My <0.00002$USD is that the group could be tighter. If people turned around because someone mentioned there’s a bear behind them, or to keep regularly checking for approaching bears, I wouldn’t fault them at all. How does anyone know that’s not the case?",CarlDonohue,"RyanKBrook,AEDerocher",https://twitter.com/CarlDonohue/status/964274840290017280,1518736011
"I look forward to reading that paper, Andy. Personally I'd bet Darwin would be looking at the rock lichens if he were there.",yukondoug,AEDerocher,https://twitter.com/yukondoug/status/963802490465525760,1518623394

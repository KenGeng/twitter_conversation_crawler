"I had a real “OMG this is Australia, and I’m here.” moment. I know kangaroos are very very common in Aus, but I’ve never seen them in the wild, and it felt like a big deal for me.",BettePiddler,liberal_parnell,https://twitter.com/BettePiddler/status/1020951838001061889,1532248861
That's awesome. I'd love to see them. I'm glad you had such a cool moment. I was like that when I was in Alaska and in a small boat and we were surrounded by a pod of whales feeding. It was pretty amazing.,liberal_parnell,BettePiddler,https://twitter.com/liberal_parnell/status/1021119391272857601,1532288809
I’ve never seen a whale in the wild. It must be breathtaking. They are such majestic creatures.,BettePiddler,liberal_parnell,https://twitter.com/BettePiddler/status/1021607699971108864,1532405230

I saw a small mob a few months back as I was dropping the car off for a service. In the middle of suburban Sydney like a bloody cliche! Still amazing.,dammitalltohell,"BettePiddler,athyvaya",https://twitter.com/dammitalltohell/status/1021609317970001920,1532405616

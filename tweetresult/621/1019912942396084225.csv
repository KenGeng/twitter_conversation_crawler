"iPhone users! I have a choice between the iPhone 7 or the 8 for an extra £10 a month on contract. Is there any major differences between the 7 and the 8? ,#,Iphones, ,#,Apple",GwerfylEdwards,,https://twitter.com/GwerfylEdwards/status/1019912942396084225,1532001169
I went from the 6 to the 8. Chris has the 7 and to be honest there isn’t much difference x,Loopy3092,GwerfylEdwards,https://twitter.com/Loopy3092/status/1020019175572549632,1532026497
Decided on the 7 ,GwerfylEdwards,Loopy3092,https://twitter.com/GwerfylEdwards/status/1020023894172987393,1532027622
The iPhone 7 doesn’t have a headphone jack if you listen to music it comes with a dongle but it’s always breaking. I’ve had to buy 4 dongles since Xmas cos it’s so badly made it makes the earphones only work in one ear,sadlerfiona21,GwerfylEdwards,https://twitter.com/sadlerfiona21/status/1019916950712045569,1532002124
Oh thanks for that. I do listen to a bit of music through my phone tbh so want something that’s pretty reliable.,GwerfylEdwards,sadlerfiona21,https://twitter.com/GwerfylEdwards/status/1019925456739553280,1532004152
I bought my daughter the iPhone 7 last xmas cos she want 128gb of storage cos she takes loads of photos and loves her music but I’m saving up for some wireless headphones for her cos I’m sick of buying new dongles. She does love the iPhone 7 though,sadlerfiona21,GwerfylEdwards,https://twitter.com/sadlerfiona21/status/1019930656598642688,1532005392

"I just fancied a change I've had a few iPhones, the 4, 5s, 6 & 6s. Though I do love my iPad, use far more than my laptop.",BarryMeps,GwerfylEdwards,https://twitter.com/BarryMeps/status/1019929603748585472,1532005141
I've jumped ship from an iPhone to a Google pixel 2 XL too. iPhones storage was shocking and this cost me less than an upgrade to the newest iPhones xx,BeckyMeaghan,GwerfylEdwards,https://twitter.com/BeckyMeaghan/status/1019931147176947713,1532005509

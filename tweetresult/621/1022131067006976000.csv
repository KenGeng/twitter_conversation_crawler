"""The pursuit of thinner, lighter laptops, a trend driven by Apple, means we have screwed ourselves out of performance.""

Except it wasn't us, it was ,@,Apple,. Everyone I know has been yelling at them to get their shit together, but it seems they just want... alternative iPads.,https://,twitter.com/motherboard/st,atus/1021753478757142531, ,…",s1guza,,https://twitter.com/s1guza/status/1022131067006976000,1532530011
"It wasn't apple. Apple sells what people want to buy, so if that's what they're making, then that's what people want.",Emin_s_,"s1guza,Apple",https://twitter.com/Emin_s_/status/1022164056319426560,1532537876
"If that were true, they'd need A/B options in the first place. An iPhone 7 with headphone jack, and one without. A MBP with Touchbar, one without (but same specs, not LQ shit). But they don't. They just come up with whatever they want, knowing that alternatives are still worse.",s1guza,"Emin_s_,Apple",https://twitter.com/s1guza/status/1022165805188960256,1532538293
I guess Apple doesn't operate that way. They release what they think people will like and people do happen to like what they release.,Emin_s_,"s1guza,Apple",https://twitter.com/Emin_s_/status/1022255674556928002,1532559720
"I'd argue people buy it anyway because they have no better option since the competitors' products are still inferior, or it's an immense pain to switch.",s1guza,"Emin_s_,Apple",https://twitter.com/s1guza/status/1022257343927656448,1532560118
"That's also true. It can be pretty hard to switch to a different ecosystem, especially one like Apple.",Emin_s_,"s1guza,Apple",https://twitter.com/Emin_s_/status/1022264671586459648,1532561865
"Still waiting and hoping for a significant upgrade to my 2012 MBP. Unfortunately the best upgrades are Windows machines. I upgraded my SSD and have been waiting ever since. , Probably have to just get a Windows machine at some point and give up.",graymalk,s1guza,https://twitter.com/graymalk/status/1022134720384167936,1532530882
"I have the early 2015 13'' model, last one before they introduced TouchID and fail keyboards. The 2015 models seem to be quite an upgrade from 2012 ones and have no shit yet, as far as I can tell...",s1guza,graymalk,https://twitter.com/s1guza/status/1022135839927754752,1532531149
Yeah I should probably have bought in 2015 ,graymalk,s1guza,https://twitter.com/graymalk/status/1022137277273841664,1532531491
I've developed a workaround that is contributing to my purchasing paralysis: I've learned how to run workloads in the cloud. My desire for tons of cores and RAM is now almost fully satisfied.,graymalk,"graymalk,s1guza",https://twitter.com/graymalk/status/1022142747900170240,1532532796

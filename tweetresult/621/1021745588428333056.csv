Without the SD card and audio Jack?,nirmaltv,ePandu,https://twitter.com/nirmaltv/status/1021747038982004737,1532438451
"Response to lack of audio jack is going to be interesting. People will criticise but end up learning to live with it. As for microSD card slot, most will not care",ePandu,nirmaltv,https://twitter.com/ePandu/status/1021747810402795520,1532438635
"When Xiaomi itself projects dedicated slot as a feature, will wait and see how they justify it.",nirmaltv,ePandu,https://twitter.com/nirmaltv/status/1021748036039372801,1532438689

"Given that the Mi A1 users (most) are fed up with the update delays and bugs plus the small battery and lack of headphone jack, I'm quite looking forward to it...Mi A2 sales figures will reveal more about market preferences in this segment",aj_naufal,ePandu,https://twitter.com/aj_naufal/status/1021801701953744896,1532451484
"This is a big statement.
